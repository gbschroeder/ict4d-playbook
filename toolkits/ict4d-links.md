In the first 15 months of the dialogue, the Red Cross/Red Crescent conducted regional consultations in six technology hubs to explore barriers to resilience and to learn the underlying attitudes, beliefs, questions and concerns influencing each urban community’s perceptions of emerging technology. We honed in on emerging technology solutions urban dwellers believe will not only address their emergency needs but also enhance their daily lives, as they are introduced to consumer over the next five to 10 years.

### Statistics

- [Africa Data and Numbers - Updated](http://www.oafrica.com/data/) -- The site began in August 2009 as a project to raise awareness of how Africans – everyday citizens and entrepreneurs alike – constructively utilize the Internet. I have always had a passion for the Internet and all of the doors it can open. However, the project soon took on greater meaning. I was surprised at the sheer volume of information relating to ICT and felt the urge to help organize even a fraction of it. The opportunities for mobile technology to improve health and agriculture are enormous. What’s more, I was amazed at how news stories from large economies like Kenya dominated global headlines about Africa and left exciting news from smaller economies in the dark.

- [TASCHA Report on Global Impact Study - Survey Resources](http://www.globalimpactstudy.org/resources/resources-surveys/) -- The Global Impact Study of Public Access to Information & Communication Technologies was a five-year project (2007-2012) to generate evidence about the scale, character, and impacts of public access to information and communication technologies. Looking at libraries, telecenters, and cybercafes, the study investigated impact in a number of areas, including communication and leisure, culture and language, education, employment and income, governance, and health.

- [OpenAidData](http://www.openaiddata.org/) -- Provides detailed developing aid data from around the world. Unlike most other websites, this project combines data from various sources offering a more comprehensive view. Sources include the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) of the OECD, the World Bank and the Illicit Financial FLow data set from Global Financial Integrity. So far, Openaiddata.org has combined over 3 million rows of data. 

- [Download speeds around the world](http://www.netindex.com/download/allcountries/) -- Based on millions of recent test results from Ookla Speedtest, this index compares and ranks consumer download speeds around the globe. The value is the rolling mean speed in Mbps over the past 30 days. Only tests taken within 300 miles of the server are eligible for inclusion in the index.

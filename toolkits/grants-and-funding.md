## Highlights for Peace Corps-projects

[directly to Volunteers]

- Think about SPA (USAID) *and* PCPP
- SPA has various categories (posts negotiate with USAID Mission locally to figure out what to focus on)
- Timing of funding information and grants related more to IST -- probably through PDM framework (look into Manual)
- Is there overlap with: 
	- Feed the Future
	- 'VAST' - PEPFAR-funded (HIV/AIDS)
	- Global Education Framework
	- Steven's Fund (PCPP)

As Peace Corps Volunteers, we embrace 'starting where you are, using what you have, and doing what you can.'[^ashe]

Small grants can make a significant difference in a community’s development and have an outsized impact on your projects and activities. Whether it is bringing young girls together to participate in a STEM camp, introducing mobile financial payment services to a local women’s group, or implementing an HIV/AIDS GIS training for at-risk, individuals —— small grants can lead to lasting positive change. 

## Grants for ICT4D Projects

When it comes to ICT4D initiatives, there are a few things you'll want to consider in addition to all of the standard grant and project management policies and procedures. Primarily, you'll just want to make sure that your project proposal is using information and/or communication technologies in a way that enables or empowers your community in a sustainable, accessible, and impactful way. This probably isn't something that you'll want to jump into out of the gate as a new Volunteers, but should be worked out in conjuction with your Peace Corps country staff and community counterparts.

The best place to start would be to check out the [Principles for Digital Development](http://digitalprinciples.org/) -- which were written by and for international development donors and their implementing partners -- they serve as guidance rather than edict, and are updated over time.

Inside, you'll find guidance on how to think about things like designing with the user in mind, sustainability, using open standards and systems, addressing privacy, and more. You can learn more about Peace Corps' take on the Principles in the [Playbook Guide](/guide/principles/)

## Types of Resources

As you're thinking about various grants and funding for your projects, you'll want to be thinking about the various types of grants available to you, and how that might steer your processes in one direction or another. For example, the primary funding sources specifically for Peace Corps Volunteers are the [Small Projects Assistance (SPA)](http://www.peacecorps.gov/ggm/smallgrants/) and the [Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP)](http://www.peacecorps.gov/ggm/smallgrants/).

Under the umbrella of small grants, there are useful categories of reserved funding to keep in mind. So there are various programs Volunteer Activities Support and Training (VAST), Feed the Future (FTF), Global Education Framework (GEF), and Energy Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA).

#### Categories for ICT4D Projects

In addition to the various categories above, there are ones that would be particularly interesting for ICT4D projects. 

###### Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens Memorial Fund

The Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens Memorial Fund was established to honor the memory and service of former United States Ambassador and returned Peace Corps Volunteer, J. Christopher Stevens, who served in Morocco. Contributions to this fund support approved community-initiated and Volunteer-led projects that build bridges between young people globally.

###### Business Development Fund

Volunteers are posted throughout the developing world to help local businesses thrive in ways they never thought possible. Increasing the opportunities presented to local businesses promotes a sense of empowerment that can truly change a community. Contributions to this fund will support Volunteer and community projects such as microfinance, agribusiness, business education, and artisan collectives.

They do a great job of working both with the Volunteer *and* the community (especially as Volunteers transition in and out of service). They ask all of the right questions and help to make sure that any donated computers and systems don't end up gathering dust in the locked-up library, but are put into the hands of students ready to learn from them.

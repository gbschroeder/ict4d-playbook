title: Starting an ICT4D Committee

First off--welcome to the future. :smiley:

I believe that technology can improve peoples' lives. Not automatically, not overnight, and not without thoughtful effort. But it has happened, does happen, and with your help, will happen time and time again.

By reading this, you're part of that story now -- and we need all of the help we can get!

## What is an ICT4D committee?

Volunteers are able to share information, collaborate, and work as a team to help all Volunteers in their post (and more and more at the global level) by forming working groups or committees that revolve around a given topic, such as Gender Equality, Volunteer Advisory Councils, Youth as Resources, etc.



## Why ICT4D committees?

Volunteers form ICT4D (or T4D)[^ict4d] committees in order to meet a specific need among their fellow Volunteers by pooling together the resources and Volunteer support of those are more knowleadge and interested in the data, information, communications, and technology aspects of their service.

These committees can exist as very formal and organized committees with staff input, all the way to just an informal group of Volunteers communicating digitally on these topics. What they all have in common is the recognition that projects and activities can be made more effective and impactful by appropriately leveraging ICTs.

Under the right circumstances, having a core group of Volunteers on hand to help support other Volunteers, to fill the gaps of technical and technological skill sets and to make communications simpler pays incredible dividends to all Volunteers in a country (and by extension around the world.)



### Current committees

Here are a list of current committees in Peace Corps -- if you would like yours to be added, just [email me](mailto:gkrieshok@peacecorps.gov)

- Thailand (T4D Committee)
- Botswana
- Ghana (Think Tank Committee)
- Georgia (T4D Committee)
- Ethiopia (T4D Committee)

## The roles of an ICT4D committee in Peace Corps

These are just to get you started. As we know, every single Peace Corps region, posting, Volunteer community, and host-country community are unique, and present their individual challenges requiring their own tailored solutions.

In forming a working group or committee you (either as an individual or as a group) will want to think about the perspectives of Peace Corps staff, where your fellow Volunteers are at (skill sets, experiences, enthusiasm), and what has been tried before. If a committee existed years ago on this issue -- what happened, why is it no longer around, what could you do differently? OK, trigger warnings aside, here are the six roles that seem to pop up:

### 1. ICT education for communities

Basic computer education, digital literacy, advanced computer classes, programming, etc...

### 2. IT support for Volunteers

Computer training, virus protection, VRF support, etc.

### 3. Communications for Volunteers

Helping Volunteers find best phone plans, how to use different services, mobile financial services, etc.

The ICT4D Committee can keep in contact with communication representatives from all other committees to offer guidance in updating the website.

### 4. Social media for Volunteers and post

Promoting Volunteer blogs, creating original content for the official Peace Corps Post website.

Often, posts have websites and social media presence (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) that are maintained by a combination of Peace Corps staff, local staff, and Volunteers. These accounts can be managed in whole or in part by a T4D Committee.

Related to social media, committees can think more broadly about all types of media production. It can be a powerful tool to educate the public in almost every topic. I.e. malaria, healthy reproduction practices, math, security, nutrition, how to be a peace corps volunteer, etc... The ICT4D committee can assist volunteers and committees at making resources that can make a stronger impact in human development.

### 5. Targeted focus on a topic for a host-country audience

STEM-related activities, GLOW camps, Camp TechKobwe, Uganda's TechCamp, etc...

More broadly, ICT4D committees can assist communities, counterparts, co-operatives, and others at maintaining appropriate technology acquired by host country nationals.

ICT4D does not necessarily have to limit itself to high-tech activities, such as computer labs and mobile phones. We can help with guidance and support for all ICTs and ecosystems including libraries, makerspaces, mechanical tools, etc. 

### 6. Targeted focus on a topic for a Volunteer audience

GIS and Mapping, hardware and appropriate technology, design thinking or user-centered design for Volunteers.

Volunteers respond most efficiently and effectively to the challenges unique to their site and communities. They might be able to articulate the challenge quite well, but not with the realm of possible solutions and ideas for addressing that challenge -- where the ICT4D committee might be able to shed assist and point to resources, personnel, examples, and approaches. 

Finally, the ICT4D Committee works to increase resources and areas where volunteers can go to search for information concerning previously completed projects. 



## What do we call ourselves?

... or tSquad or a Think Tank...or what?!

This is for you to decide! I'm sure there's someone in Peace Corps/Washington who would love it if all groups had the same name--but that's not this specialist. I tend to think of the names groups gives themselves as extensions of the groups themselves, so if it's advantageous and fun to be called a 'squad', then go for it.

 If you find it useful to fit into the country's dichotomy of names (you have a GENEQ Committee, a Let Girls Learn Committee, etc.) and there might be travel and funding implications, then best stick with that convention.



## Scoping out your mission

There are a number of ways to come up with a 'value statement' or mission. I would recommend thinking about it like an 'elevator pitch' -- something concise but directed that you can use to explain who you are, why you exist, and what you need:

- Who you are – why are you uniquely from other similar organizations
- What you do – what is it specifically that you do uniquely well and what are the - results
- Why should I believe you – your experience, credentials, etc “Why you’re awesome”
- Immediate Ask – usually for a sit down meeting

I have seen these successful mission statements from other Committees:

- To empower volunteers and communities to leverage information and communication technologies to improve communities and livelihoods by developing resources and acting as an information exchange network across all sectors and countries of Peace Corps.

- Strengthen host country capacity related to T4D. As a result, host country community members will have greater opportunity and capacity to learn, communicate, and participate in local, regional, national and global discussions, get a job, expand businesses, and access resources.

- To share modern technologies and solutions in order to contribute to the development of a more modern [insert country]

- To leverage technologies towards the goals of Peace Corps volunteers while enhancing the lives of all persons living in Ghana. Whilst helping our fellow volunteers find appropriate technical solutions for difficult situations, enhancing their experience here in Ghana. This will also enable Peace Corps Ghana to implement ICT technologies efficiently. We also provide ongoing support to fellow volunteers in providing resources and technical expertise whilst keeping abreast on the changes in technology.

- Enhancing Peace Corps Uganda operations for Volunteers and staff and empowering local communities with technology.

## Holding meetings

Again -- no magic solution here. These are some examples:

- "Meetings will be held on a TBA basis at least three times a year. Elections will be held at the All-Volunteer Conference. Each meeting should have these parts:
	- PCVs to share accomplished work, discuss relevant updates, and determine agenda items for the next meeting.
	- Informs PC staff about agenda items for the next meetings.
	- Meets to establish and execute objectives for all relevant initiatives/sub-sectors for the next meeting.
- Any member who does not report in for two consecutive meetings can be removed from their post as determined by a majority vote by the committee.
- In order for a meeting to be official, at least 60% elected members or their alternate(s) must be present.""

## Members

### Project Developers / Coordinators:

"These are the generators and implementers of project ideas.""

"If representative is removed or resigns; the position will be open to anyone in that region.""

### General Membership 

"Membership is open to all country Volunteers.""



## Leadership

Note that these are not always required -- just here as a reference. Your mileage may vary.

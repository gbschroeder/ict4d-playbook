title: Starting an ICT4D Committee Reader

This toolkit will help Peace Corps Volunteers in either creating an ICT4D (or T4D) committee from scratch or in keeping one up and running. Obviously it's not definitive, and we'll always need your help!

First off, welcome to the future. I believe that technology can improve peoples' lives. Not automatically, not overnight, and not without thoughtful effort, but it has happened, does happen, and with your help, will happen time and time again.

By reading this, you're part of that story now -- and we need all of the help we can get!

### Why ICT4D committees?

> "Volunteers are going to do it anyway—why do you need a committee for it?"

First, you'll want to make sure you've asked yourselves this question and that you have a response to it. 'Volunteer Committees' in Peace Corps have a long and storied tradition, and you'll find varying levels of support from staff and fellow Volunteers—everything from full-throated enthusiasm to downright skepticism. Know your stakeholders, and know your audience. Maybe what you need isn't so much a Committee as it is a Whatsapp or Facebook group.

Yet in the right circumstances, having a core group of Volunteers on hand to help support other Volunteers, to fill the gaps of technical and technological skill sets and to make communications simpler pays incredible dividends to all Volunteers in a country (and by extension around the world.)

### The roles of an ICT4D committee in Peace Corps

These are just to get you started. As we know, every single Peace Corps region, posting, Volunteer community, and host-country community are unique, and present their individual challenges requiring their own tailored solutions. In forming a working group or committee you (either as an individual or as a group) will want to think about the perspectives of Peace Corps staff, where your fellow Volunteers are at (skill sets, experiences, enthusiasm), and what has been tried before. If a committee existed years ago on this issue -- what happened, why is it no longer around, what could you do differently? OK, trigger warnings aside, here are the six roles that seem to pop up:

##### 1. ICT education for communities

Basic computer education, digital literacy, advanced computer classes, programming, etc...

##### 2. IT support for Volunteers

Computer training, virus protection, VRF support, etc.

##### 3. Communications for Volunteers

Helping Volunteers find best phone plans, how to use different services, mobile financial services, etc.

##### 4. Social media for Volunteers and post

Promoting Volunteer blogs, creating original content for the official Peace Corps Post website.

##### 5. Targeted focus on a topic for a host-country audience

STEM-related activities, GLOW camps, Camp TechKobwe, Uganda's TechCamp, etc...

##### 6. Targeted focus on a topic for a Volunteer audience

GIS and Mapping, hardware and appropriate technology, design thinking or user-centered design for Volunteers.

### Are we a committee or a working group or tSquad or a Think Tank...or what?!

This is for you to decide! I'm sure there's someone in Peace Corps/Washington who would love it if all groups had the same name--but that's not this specialist. I tend to think of the names groups gives themselves as extensions of the groups themselves, so if it's advantageous and fun to be called a 'squad', then go for it. If you find it useful to fit into the country's dichotomy of names (you have a GENEQ Committee, a Let Girls Learn Committee, etc.) and there might be travel and funding implications, then best stick with that convention.

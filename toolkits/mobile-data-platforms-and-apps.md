title: Mobile data platforms and apps

*All of these apps below are 'freemium' unless otherwise stated. This means that they basically will have free plans for most users, but your options will be limited to some degree (number of users, number of forms, export functionality, built-in sms, support, that sort of thing)*

- [Magpi](http://home.magpi.com/) -- iOS, Android  app (SMS on the Pro plan). I like their drag-and-drop builder and web-review of data entries.

- [Commcare](https://www.commcarehq.org/home/) -- Android-only, but don't let that stop you. One of the best web interfaces out there, some of the best training on their [CommCare Academy](http://learn.commcarehq.org/) site, and have worked with Peace Corps in the past (they have many RPCVs on staff). The interface is a bit clunky on the web, and it's difficult for folks to start from scratch if you don't have a programming background. Notable organizations using this include Save the Children and the WHO.

- [iFormBuilder](https://www.iformbuilder.com/) -- iOS, Android, and SMS app. Many options for data types, and does well with multiemedia. Fair documentation, and not too clunky an interface (given how complex you can make it). I love the API and data types functionality (API only on pro accounts). This is my current all around favorite. Notable organizations using it include Mercy Corps and PSI.

- [DataWinners](https://www.datawinners.com/) -- Android-only, slick drag-and-drop interface on the web. Plus, the creator is an Africa RPCV. I also love this organization because they're originally based out of Madagascar, which is where I served.

- [TaroWorks](https://www.taroworks.org/) -- Android-only, built on the Salesforce platform and originally designed for project management purposes. I haven't played with this one a ton.

- [ViewWorld](http://www.viewworld.net/) -- iOS and Android. Slick and familiar interface (Bootstrap, for you nerds). It's got good user group controls and sub-items (or sub-forms), and good data validation (by a manager or coordinator on the back-end). No "logic" functions. Organizations using it include CARE and the Danish Red Cross.

- [Epicollect](http://www.epicollect.net/) (and [Epicollect+](http://plus.epicollect.net/)) -- iOS and Android (though EpiCollect+ is Android-only). Actually a pretty slick setup, and paid for by the Imperial College London so it really is free and open-source. Uses the Google App Engine as the back-end, so some assembly required (the cost of free). Organizations using it include FAO.

- [Kobotoolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) -- Drag-and-drop interface, built on top of [ODK](https://opendatakit.org/) and [Enketo](https://enketo.org/) (web forms). I haven't played with it that much, to be honest. Organizations using it include USAID, IRC, 

- [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) -- Android-only. Use [Build](https://opendatakit.org/use/build/) or [XLSForm](https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/) to create the survey form, [Collect](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/) to fill-in the survey, and then [Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) to host the survey results. Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but it's the cost of the actual free thing that underlies a lot of these other platforms out there.

- [POIMapper](http://www.poimapper.com/) -- iOS and Android, fairly straightfoward but focused on maps (POI is Point Of Interest).

- [Tangerine - EGRA](http://www.tangerinecentral.org/projects/egra) -- Electronic data collection software designed for use on mobile computers, including netbooks, tablet computers and smartphones. Its primary use is to enable recording of studentsâ€™ responses in oral early grade reading and mathematics skills assessments, specifically Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA), and interview responses from students, teachers and principals on home and school context information.

- [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com/) -- Web-based platform for forms. Can also be integrated into other platforms.

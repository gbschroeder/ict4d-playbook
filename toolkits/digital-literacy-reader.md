# Introduction

All Volunteers are educators, across all sectors and in all countries.

We live in an increasingly digital world where communities (even remote ones) are often keenly aware of the potential benefits to be gained from skill sets associated with computers mobile phones, and the Internet. They are also aware of the risk associated with not being digitally literate for themselves and for their future generations.

<div class="note"><h6>What is the Digital Divide?</h6>

<p>The rapid diffusion of technologies around the world—of computers and mobile phones, of opportunities around tech-related jobs and careers, and of access to on-demand services and information—has not necessarily benefitted everyone.</p>

<p>The gulf between the technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ has been called the ‘Digital Divide’ — the social and economic inequality that exists with regards to the access to, use of, or impact of ICTs.</p>

<p>The Digital Divide is not just the inequality between rich and poor countries — it is the gap in geography, in status, in generation , in race, and in gender. If there’s limited understanding about how it all works, these new users will likely miss out.</p>

<p>Our role is to act as catalysts to bridge this divide; to build on the existing historical and market forces that have led to the amazing diffusion of technology and innovation and ensure that it can benefit as many lives as possible.</p>

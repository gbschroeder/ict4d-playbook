### Apps and Applications for coding

- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) -- Program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. There's also the [ScratchEd](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/) portal for walk-throughs and support, [ScratchJr](http://www.scratchjr.org/), which is an app for the iPad and Android tabelts, and this [6-unit Introduction to Scratch from Harvard](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/).

- [Kodable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kodable/id577673067?mt=8) -- iPad, desktop, and Android-compatible; ages 5+; can set up so students can continue where they left off.

- [Lightbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightbot-one-hour-coding/id873943739) (One-Hour Coding): iPad, Android, and web browser; some reading involved with commands; non-readers cannot use independently

- [Tynker](http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code/) -- Drag-and-drop coding that eliminates syntax, with option to show the code as text, [school info](http://www.tynker.com/school/) and a [video](http://youtu.be/zK_EWkzmw64); good for K–8; getting started videos to help teachers create a classroom, add students, choose a lesson plan; tutorials and gallery contain ready-to-use projects and lessons; [info about coding for 2nd–7th graders](http://www.tynker.com/blog/articles/teacher-profiles/early-cs-education-in-grades-2-7/)

- [Blockly](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) -- Game-based programming.

This toolkit is a collection of ICT-related websites and resources that might be of interest to those Volunteer projects looking to leverage technologies in their projects. If you're looking for particular software, I recommend checking out the [Peace Corps on-a-Stick](peacecorps.github.org/peace-corps-on-a-stick/) project.

If you're looking for support around a particular thematic area ([Education](/icts-for-education/), [Digital Literacy](/digital-literacy/), [GIS](/gis-and-mapping/), etc.) then you should check out [Toolkits](/toolkits/) overview to see if one of them is more suited to your needs.

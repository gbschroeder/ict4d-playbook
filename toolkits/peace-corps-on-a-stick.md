# Introduction

*I am giving it the code name 'Sneaker Drive' in reference to the idea that software on USB sticks and external hard drives can travel faster on-foot than the Internet in some places—especially where Volunteers serve.*

Just as we support Volunteers with portablemedical kits, water filters, mosquito nets, and Peace Corps manuals on critical skills and  approaches, we must also support them with digital tools and resources. Many posts, programs, and Volunteer committees are already doing this -- providing valuable resources via USB drives distributed to Volunteers at various times during their service.

The list below is simply the *list* of useful/interesting software that folks have come across. You can find disk images of *all* the software in the Releases (TBD) tab.

I am working on figuring out a convenient, sustainable delivery system of USB sticks to Volunteers (through med-kits refreshes, incoming training groups, etc.) Let me know if you have thoughts by either creating an issue here or contacting at ict4d@peacecorps.gov!

# Software



##### Portable Apps

A portable app is a “lite” version of a software, which can be run without being installed on the host computer, and which doesn’t modify the computer’s configuration information. In other words, you can run it, and use it, and you won't disturb the computer or settings.



### Antivirus and Malware

Computer viruses are a problem throughout the world -- and are compounded in many Peace Corps countries where limited and expensive connectivity means that anti-virus software, definitions, and malware protection are often not up-to-date with the latest protections. You'll encounter many computers and USB drives with viruses that have been "identified and destroyed" years ago for most U.S.-based computer users.

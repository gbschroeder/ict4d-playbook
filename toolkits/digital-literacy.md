title: Digital Literacy
---

This toolkit is intended to provide an accessible introduction and link to resources, primarily for Peace Corps Volunteers, who are interested in promoting digital literacy (which includes introductions to computer hardware, basic skills in operating computers and mobile devices, and introductions to computer science and computer programming) to their communities at any age and skill level.

# Introduction

Greetings, digital native Millenials! The objective here is to begin to outline different ways in which you as a Peace Corps Volunteer can help not only to support your existing projects and programs through digital literacy, but really how to more fundamentally support your community in being able to take advantage of the digital landscape of opportunities that may be present to them.

In addition to providing links to online resources, this toolkit provides tips and resources in offline settings and environments for Volunteer settings. As this toolkit develops, our hope is that this can also serve as the basis for a set of curricula to be carried out by Volunteers (with individual tailorings for country, community, language, context, etc.).



##### Why Digital Literacy for Peace Corps Volunteers

All Volunteers are educators in one capacity or another—across all sectors and all countries. We live in an increasingly digital world where communities (even remote ones) are often keenly aware of the potential benefits to be gained from skill sets associated with computers mobile phones, and the Internet.

> Volunteers work to narrow the economic and social inequality in the access to, use of, and/or impact of ICTs in their communities; and to empower everyone through computer, mobile, and digital tools.

They are also aware of the risk associated with not being digitally literate for themselves and for their future generations.

There are a number of ways in which Volunteers help their communities to take advantage of digital and technological opportunities, including:

- Basic computer skills in classrooms for students, youth, and adults.
- Intermediate computer and Internet literacy—operating systems, productivity software, web browsers.
- Advanced digital literacy related to library and computer labs, computer programming, media production, and digital responsibility.
- Technology-oriented clubs and camps for youth that incorporate ICTs into life-skills, youth development, and other sectoral areas.

One of the areas that Peace Corps Volunteers are particularly interested in is in discovering ways to teach and promote digital literacy in offline or 'lo-fi' (without regular or intermittent connectivity) enviornments.

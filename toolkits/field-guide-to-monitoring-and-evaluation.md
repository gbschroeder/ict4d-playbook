## Peace Corps systems, theories, tools, and lenses

One of the challenging aspects in doing Development work in general (with a big 'D') is that you must balance various frameworks and ways of looking at the world in your head at the same time in order to develop projects, planning, and approaches to your activities.

Below are just a few of the key terms you'll want to consider as you think about the role that technology and information plays as you develop more robust approaches and strategies.

- **Theory of Change/Logic Model** -- TOCs make it possible to constantly test and revise the assumptions built into the model and the assumed linkages between different levels of the model.
- **Designing for Behavior Change** -- 
- **Theory of Innovation Diffusion** -- 
- **PACA (Participatory Analysis for Community Action)** -- 
- **Human-Centered Design** -- 
- **Project Frameworks** -- 
- **Anchor Activities** -- 
- **Indicators** -- 
- **Role of the Volunteer in Development** -- 
- **Project Design and Management (PDM)** -- 
- **Project Cycle** -- 
- **Data collection tools** -- 



## Mission, vission, outputs, outcomes -- what!?

It's helpful to think through this delineation as well --

A **Mission** is what an organization is all about; what we do every day, and what we excel at. Think of it as answering the questions "what do we do, for whom, and why?". It defines our role at the highest level and describes the areas which are pre-ordained for us. 

A **Vision**, on the other hand, describes what the future will look like when we achieve our Mission. It's what will happen because we execute so superbly on our Mission. "A PC on every desk", Microsoft's early mission statement, is archetypal. 

Traditionally, one's Mission would be derived from one's Vision. Once you've decided what you want the future to look like (the Vision), you pick the Mission which will get you there. 

1. **Vision dictates Mission**
2. **which determines Strategy**
3. **which surfaces Goals**
4. **that frame Objectives**
5. **which in turn drive the Tactics**
6. **to deliver Key Results**



## Defining simple projects, complicated programs and complex interventions[^1]

### Simple projects

- Include relatively simple “blue-print” designs that produce a standardized product
- Follow a causal path that is relatively linear
- Have defined start and end dates making it time-bound
- Have only a few objectives but they are clearly defined
- Define a target population that is usually relatively small
- Have a well defined budget and resources.

### Complicated programs

- Include a number of different projects each with its own “blueprint”
- Follow causal paths for different components and different objectives, but are still relatively
liNear
- Have information on the process of project implementation that is often not well documented
- Target a larger and more diverse population
- Involve several different donors and national agencies
- May be implemented by different donors in slightly different ways
- Set objectives in broader and less clearly defined terms
- Set up without start-end dates, thus not so time-bound
- Focus on the importance of program context
- Merge funds into ministry budgets, making it difficult to estimate.

### Complex interventions

- Merge into national or sector development policy, making specific program interventions difficult to identify
- Follow non-linear causal paths, as there may be multiple paths to achieve an outcome, or the same set of inputs may produce different outcomes in different settings
- Are delivered by multiple agencies, and components and service are not delivered in a uniform manner
- Have emergent designs that evolve over time
- Have program objectives that are difficult to define or not specified
- Have non-proportional relationships between inputs and outcomes.

- [Comic Life](http://plasq.com/apps/comiclife/macwin/) -- It costs $30 but Comic Life is a good way to lay out comic strips -- I've seen it used for various public health campaigns.

- [Go Animate](http://goanimate.com/) -- The folks at the HHS Idea Lab have used GoAnimate with success for short videos. Might be worth checking out.

- [PowToon](http://www.powtoon.com/) -- Powtoon for animated videos and Bitstrips for cartoons are both free.

- [BitStrips for Schools](http://www.bitstripsforschools.com/) -- Powtoon for animated videos and Bitstrips for cartoons are both free.

- [Xtranormal](http://xtranormal.com/) -- Xtranormal used to be the great one for goofy stuff it looks like they might re-open soon.

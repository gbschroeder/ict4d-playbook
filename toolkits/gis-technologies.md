## Cloud-based GIS and Mapping Platforms

- [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) -- The industry standard right now. Has directions, ability to add custom layers/point, Street View, and a bunch of other things. Also has apps with more and more increased (and offline) functionality for smartphones.

- [OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org) -- Open-source map created by community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world. Check out the [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) for more information.

- [Here Maps](https://www.here.com/) -- Road-centric maps. Built by a consortium of car manufacturers -- the offline apps are really great.



## Software and Platforms

- [ESRI - ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) -- The industry-standard in GIS software and solutions. Better with enterprise accounts, but you're able to do a trial version to make interested layered maps on their ArcGIS Online platform. The suite of ESRI tools is pretty expansive, ranging from consumer-level items like their smartphone apps all the way up to enterprise-level server platforms. If you're getting involved in GIS, you've no doubt heard this name, especially with respect to ArcGIS Desktop.

	- Limitations: Price tag, desktop software processes, high learning curve and training/expertise investment, proprietary formats.

- [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) -- Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. Basically compares to ArcGIS Desktop (with even a few bells and whistles added). It's a little *less* user friendly, and it's more-or-less a standalone GIS solution (it won't host the content or provide you raw datasets). Check out the tutorials to level up on this if you're ready to move past looking at OpenStreetMap layers. Also has Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available.

	- Limitations: Not a full GIS package in that it still requires external tools (cloud or web-based software) to translate the data into something dynamic or more visually appealing.

	- [QGIS Tutorials and Tips](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/) -- Great documentation from the QGIS team.

	- [QGIS Walkthrough (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0r1GNTT-0o) -- Video introduction from the TechChange team to QGIS.

	- [QGIS Interactive Tutorial from Harvard](http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/) -- A little dated but still good tutorial walking through the QGIS interface.



## Browser-based GIS Services

- [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) -- Browser-based mapping and analysis of location data.

- [CartoDB Map Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/) -- Learn how to create maps on the web and visualize geospatial data using CartoDB.

- [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/) -- Pick from a dozen beautifully designed maps and create an application from it in just a few seconds. Great for creating visually appealing maps from preexisting or pre-cleaned data. Also has iOS, Android, and mobile web versions.

- [Mapbox Studio - Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) -- Design studio to create stunning interactive maps (formerly TileMill).

- [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/) -- Toner, terrain, and watercolor maps, free for the taking.

- [Dropchop.io](http://dropchop.io/) -- Browser-based GIS powered by Mapbox.js and Turf.js

- [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) -- A web-based platform for mapping information from reports from SMS, Twitter, e-mail, and web. Initially used to map election violence and intimidation in Kenya.



## Other GIS Technologies and Platforms

There are a lot of different types of applications to support mapping, GIS, and geospatial workflows in a variety of applications. I have personally worked with a number of offices to figure out different ways to approach their business case for various mapping cases, and established an agency working group to articulate all the various use cases and technologies across the agency so that we can get the best bang for our buck.

- [Google Fusion Tables](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?dsrcid=implicit&pli=1) -- An experimental data visualization web application to gather, visualize, and share data tables. Allows for maps, charts, Motion Chart a.k.a. GapMinder, etc.

- [Google Spreadsheet Chart Maps](https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/tutorials/spreadsheet3.html) -- Quick but can sometimes be limited. Convenient if you're already using Google Sheets.

- [MapBox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.3.0/) -- Built on top of [Leaflet](), is an open-source library to be used with Javascript.

- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) -- an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps

- [D3](https://d3js.org/) -- JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. Helps make awesome maps -- but has a high learning curve.



## Visualization Software

- [Tableau](http://www.tableausoftware.com/) -- Data visualization and business intelligence software (with built-in mapping charts and widgets).

- [R (stats package)](https://www.r-project.org/) -- 'R' is a free software programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R's extensible object-system includes objects for (among others): regression models, time-series and geo-spatial coordinates.

- [Processing (programming language)](https://processing.org/) -- Open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities.

- [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) -- Typically used for vector art, but also great for doing visualization of certain map parts.

- [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) -- The industry standard for imaging and design.



## Advanced Analysis

## Geospatial-related Databases

- [COD Fundamental Registry](https://cod.humanitarianresponse.info/country-region) -- The Common Operational Datasets (CODs) are critical datasets that are used to support the work of humanitarian actors across multiple sectors. They are considered a de facto standard for the humanitarian community and should represent the best-available datasets for each theme.

- [GeoNames Name Server](http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/) -- Official repository of standard spellings of all foreign geographic names, sanctioned by the United States Board on Geographic Names (US BGN). The database also contains variant spellings (cross-references), which are useful for finding purposes, as well as non-Roman script spellings of many of these names. Download the [Country Files](http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.html) for offline use.

- [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) -- Covers all countries and contains over eight million placenames that are available for download free of charge.

- [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)](http://dhsprogram.com/) -- DHS analyzes and distributes survey results regarding health, nutrition, HIV for over 75 countries.

- [The World Bank Maps](http://maps.worldbank.org/) -- Mapping data globally, regionally, country-level, and thematically across all World Bank projects.

- [AidData](http://aiddata.org/maps) -- Geospatial data and tools enabling development stakeholders to more effectively target, coordinate and evaluate aid. Lots of good datasets and analysis in the International Development sector.

- [Poverty Net - World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty) -- Resource site for measuring and analyzing poverty - includes Poverty Mapping section under Topics link, with Poverty Mapping Documents and Links which has good links to examples of articles and programs.

- [GeoPlatform](http://www.geoplatform.gov/) -- Shared and trusted geospatial data, services, and applications for use by the public and by government agencies and partners to meet their mission needs. Integrated with Data.gov.

- [UNDP Projects](http://open.undp.org/?goback=%2Egde_65094_member_191436479#2012) -- Detailed information on the UNDP’s 6,000+ development projects in 177 countries and territories worldwide. Browse the summaries, click a filter on the right, or search through the full list of projects.

## Shape Files

Shape files are used in a lot of online and GIS software platforms to identify and demarcate the 2-dimensional polygon of a region, country, area, etc. Rather than having to re-draw these yourself, you can find use these free sources. : )

- [Natural Earth Data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) -- Public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data

- [Ellipsoid World with georeference lines and names](https://www.your-vector-maps.com/hi/-144-free-vector-world-maps/-ellipsoid-world-with-georeference-lines-and-names-jpg-300-dpi/?image=wrld-bm-2) -- Site with a bunch of links to vector-based maps and shape files of the whole Earth. Good for building things in Illustrator or Sketch or the web.

- [Vector Maps](https://www.freevectormaps.com/world-maps) -- Various formats and projections.

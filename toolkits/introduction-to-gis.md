Are you interested in creating a map to help your community assess their environment? Are you trying to catalog the projects of local organizations, groups, and fellow Volunteers? Are you concerned with mapping out zones and neighborhoods that are unsafe for Volunteers? Are you interested in visualizing the effect of your project and your efforts over time?

Understanding your objectives from the outset will help to ask the right questions, pick the right mapping platform(s), and learn on the best tools for the task.

# Introduction

Welcome, cartography nerds! Our purpose here is to provide a basic overview and links to resources to get you started in GIS and mapping during your service as a Peace Corps Volunteer (and beyond).

It's important to remember that this field can be absolutely **HUGE** and sometimes overwhelming. Don't be discouraged! There are many points of entry, and even a little knowledge in this stuff can go a long way to making your projects more effective, transparent, and sustainable. So hopefully there's something for everyone here, and this toolkit can help you to level-up your mapping skills.

We want the Peace Corps community to learn to analyze, map, and publish spatial information using GIS tools that are available and appropriate in the field. We hope that this guide will help to develop skills in web and paper-based cartography, collaborative online mapping, spatial data analysis, mobile phone data collection, and using and manipulating satellite and aerial imagery.

Without further ado, let's get started!


## What is GIS?

Up first—A GIS (Geospatial [or Geographic] Information System) system is 'designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data ([wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)).

When we talk about GIS, we could be referring to the academic discipline, the collection of software and platforms, processes, or even simply data that has a spatial component. Context matters here in determining which one is being discussed. Also, you'll sometimes see 'GIS' and 'Mapping' thrown around interchangeably. For our purposes in this toolkit, they are interchangeable, so try not to get hung up on them.



## What are maps?

Second—Maps. What are maps? OK, that's actually going to be a tough one, and it's a little outside of the scope here to define. Suffice it to say, this toolkit is basically going to refer to [awesome maps like this](http://americangeo.org/map-links/):

![World Map](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/5032/products/World_Maps_International_20mil_1.jpg?v=1413619116)
*Don't be tempted by the neo-colonial legacy hegemony of the oft-used [Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection). This is Peace Corps.*

But when we talk about GIS, we're not simply talking about political maps that have different colors for different countries that are neatly labeled and agreed upon.

We could be talking about specific parts of the world zoomed in from countries, even down to specific neighborhoods and addresses. It's not just labels of place names, but can be things like shapes of rivers, lakes, and mountains (topography), boundaries of areas that might include data on land ownership or voting districts (sometimes called polygons or shapes), and points of interest or dots where interesting things occur (points), as well as images overlaid on top of these maps that might show temperatures of hot spots or satellite imagery.

Phew.

Oh, and it's not just in two-dimensions (could be three or even four!), and it might not be static like a map on a wall, but dynamic like a map that lets you zoom in and out and select different layers of interest. Oh, now that I've mentionned 'layers'...



## Show me the layers

Before your mind explodes, just try to digest this image. The amazing thing about maps, mapping, GIS, and computers these days is that we can put all of these things together in new and interesting ways.

We can see relationships and data presented to us in a way that allows us to see new connections, gain new insights, and monitor important situations.

This great image below shows how these pieces *can* fit together to combine data into something that could be really interesting ([image source](http://www.co.ontario.ny.us/index.aspx?NID=1176)).

## What kinds of spatial data may be useful in my work?

Using GIS software or web tools, maps are made by combining spatial data layers to create the desired combination of geographic information. Types of layers of particular interest in Peace Corps’ work
include the following.

### Remote sensed images

These comprise satellite or aerial photography. The images must be processed and geo-referenced before they can be used. Base maps These
could be a scanned (raster) image of a paper map. Or, built up from a series of vector data layers – roads, rivers, settlements, etc.

### Administrative boundaries

Vector files showing the various levels of the country’s administrative geography (provinces, districts etc) are often essential. This
is because much situation information of humanitarian relevance is collected via the normal administrative apparatus of the country; to map, for example, disease incidence by district it is necessary to have map data showing the district boundaries.

### Human and situation data

Such as the locations of the beneficiary population, the locations of aid resources, and so on. This may be data you collect yourself,
or obtain from partners. It should be linked to your other work data sets – assessment data, programme plans, etc. Remember that any spatially-referenced
data in a suitable format can be imported into your GIS.

### Terrain

Hills and valleys can be represented by a digital elevation model (DEM) which can create a contour map layer. You know, the fun stuff.



# Getting started with projects

While we're thinking about the different *types* of GIS maps, layers, technologies, and everything else, it might be a great opportunity to take a deep breath, step back, and ask ourselves some of the important questions that will guide our efforts and thinking. You don't have to know them all now, but they're here to help -- 
 
- What is my overall objective, and who is this for?
- Who will help me build this?
- What tools (software, computing, phone, bandwidth, etc.) will I need?
- What do I know how to do, and what will I or others need to learn?
- What information do I already have, and what do I need?
- Am I putting anyone or any community at risk by collecting or displaying this information?
- What are the various policies that my counterpart or Peace Corps operate under?
- Is this a one-off platform/presentation or is this meant to be sustainable and dynamic over time?

Now that we've had some food-for-though, let's stay at 30,000 feet and thinking about *how* we approach thinking around our tools and technologies...



## Do GIS by not starting with GIS tools

Now that your mind has hopefully been blown a little bit, let's roll up our sleeves. How in the heck can you use maps in your projects? The most important piece of advice that I can give would be to think of GIS and mapping as **the thing that allows you to do the thing**, they aren't the thing itself....

...huh?

Basically this just means that you should think of GIS and mapping as tools to achieve your objectives as a Peace Corps Volunteer first, not simply as the solution that's going to magically solve things for you. One helpful exercise before even beginning to sort through the links and resources below is to define what you're wanting to do *without* invoking technology or mapping. Why do this? One, because it helps to ensure you've got a clearly articulated objective laid out ahead of you. Two, it's actually kind of difficult.



## An example of thinking without technology

Maybe you want to "create a map of all the bednets that are distributed within my community." Great! But let's think about this -- why do we want to create a map of this? What are we missing?

"...so that we can see where there are unequal distributions of the nets and correct for that on an ongoing basis..." Better, but not perfect. Maps don't do that magically -- we need to think about the data behind the map, and connect that to the lessons learned from that, and connect these two with our mapping platform as the vehicle to move us from point A to point B.

"Our team would like to correct for unequal distributions of bednets across our community in as real-time as possible." Ahhh. Doesn't that feel better? We know what we want, and we know what success is. NOW, we just get to add the tool that we'll use to achieve that -- "...by using an easily accessible and editable web-map..."



## Moving forward with confidence

This is a great start. But it also should just be the beginning. As with any project like this, you'll also want to consider things like designing with your users in mind, using open-standards, addressing privacy and security of the data, and how you're going to make this project sustainable and not simply a one-off that looks oh so cool on your DOS (Description Of Service). Lots more on this here and in other toolkits.

But enough talk -- let's get to the data! Remember that they are works in progress, and new stuff is coming down the pike every single day. Help to contribute to this toolkit (or any of the ICT4D Playbook Toolkits) by checking out the Contributing page. We need your help!

Now, be sure to check out the [GIS Technologies toolkit](/toolkits/gis-technologies/) to get a handle on the software and platforms, and also more generally the [GIS Links toolkit](/toolkits/gis-links/) for more information.

## Mapping your site

Use [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-6.1842/25.1807&layers=Q) to explore country roads and structures. If Community-Based Training (CBT) sites are known, look to see how much (or little) of the roads and buildings are accounted for when compared to satellite imagery.

For smartphones, look at apps like [OSMAND](http://osmand.net/) (Android) and [Galileo](https://galileo-app.com/) (iOS) -- Apps that access and store OSM data. Map data can be stored on your device's memory card for offline use.

### Trainees

What are the various instances where mapping your community is helpful, and how could these be supplemented through digital maps?

During site visit and various travel, are there opportunities to assess your whereabouts. These include:

- Ability to identify and record GPS coordinates (smartphone, GPS devices),
- Areas where there is voice and data connectivity (and where there isn’t),
- Routing to your town/site/house provided by adequate road and travel data (door-to-door),
- Routing to/from consolidation points and emergency locations, dangerous areas in the CBT site, in the capital for travel, on site visit, etc.,

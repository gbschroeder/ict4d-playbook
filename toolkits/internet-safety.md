description: Resources for Volunteers to teach Internet and computer safety to communities, students, and schools
---

Peace Corps Volunteers are able to witness first-hand the potential and impact of ICT tools in the learning and education in the communities where they serve. They see their students using mobile phones, computers and laptops, and connecting to the Internet, to social media, and to global messaging platforms. 

But these technologies also carry with them a variety of risks for their users, and this is particularly true for children and students.

## Overview

Internet safety isn't just about protecting oneself from computer viruses and inappropriate material (though these are certainly a part of it) -- it's about keeping kids safe online in a variety of ways so that they can have positive experiences, they are not exploited, and that their information, identity, and private information is not exposed or stolen.

There is a plethora of material that has been developed in recent years to help parents, teachers, other adults, and the children themselves to become more knowledge and prepared in ensuring that they can use ICT tools safely. 

uch of this has come from the so-called 'developed' world of OECD countries, but more and more materials are being created and adapted for use in the developing economies as well. For example, there are videos like this one (also linked below) that are geared for a Western audience -- but that Peace Corps Volunteers can use and adapt to their particular settings!

One great way I have found to think about the work of Peace Corps Volunteers working thinking about Internet Safety in their communities is from [Mike Trucano at the World Bank](http://blogs.worldbank.org/edutech/digital-safety-grid):

> "At the same time, the proliferation of mobile phones and Internet cafes mean that young people are increasingly operating in two separate digital worlds -- that of the controlled environment of (for example) a higher regimented school computer lab, where 'digital literacy' often means instruction in basic word processing applications, and the 'anything goes' context of private Internet kiosks and personal mobile phones, where the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to navigate through one's 'digital life' are much more difficult to acquire."


## Areas related to Internet safety

- **Child Abuse Images** -- Falls under larger category of child sexual exploitation.
- **Cookies** -- Data files saved by web browsers when visiting many websites. The concern is potential for privacy breach.
- **Illegal File Sharing** -- Using platforms and services to share and upload illegal content. The concern is around viruses, pornography, copyright, and privacy/identity theft.
- **Location-Based Services** -- Any wireless service or application that uses the geographical position of a wireless device. The concern is around the collection and storage of information based on current location and historical movements.
- **Online Advertising** -- The concern is around the inappropriate (or illegal) targeting of children. In the US, for example, parental consent is required to collect the data of children under thirteen years old.
- **Phishing** -- Attempt to trick users into registering or disclosing sensitive data (username, password, etc.) maliciously in order to defraud or commit identity theft.
- **Pornography** -- The concern here is around inappropriate content particularly for young adults and children.
- **Racist & Hate Content** -- The concern here is around social media, and moderated sections of the Internet where this type of activity (often illegal) occurs.
- **Spam** -- Unwanted messages, can be a window to viruses, trojans, and phishing.
- **Trojans** -- Similar to viruses, except that trojans are defined as "appearing" useful to the user.
- **Violent Content** -- The concern is around age-appropriate material.
- **Viruses** -- A piece of software written to explicitly harm the user or their computer.


## Ways to help keep children safe on the Internet

- **Education** -- Talk to students and children about using the Internet safely, about many of these issues, what they might encounter, where they should go to for assistance, etc.
- **Parental Controls** -- Enable parental control software on phones, apps, and devices where appropriate.
- **Firewalls** -- Use firewall software and hardware to protect against viruses, trojans, phishing, and malware.
- **Acceptable Use Policies** -- Create policies with your community and administrators on how systems and devices ought to be used.
- **Trusted Content** -- Offer students and children constructive opportunities and links to educational games and resources rather than simply a black-list of sites that they cannot visit.
- **Virus and malware protection** -- Be sure to update virus protections and definitions regularly. 


## Protecting personal and sensitive data

Volunteers want to make sure that they're assessing and mitigating any risks to the security of users and their data. You'll want to consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) when using systems, signing users up for platforms, and design solutions.

Finally, Volunteers will want to make sure that there is equity and fairness in technology use and that we are doing everything we can to protect the best interests of the end-users.

A great resource is the [Ways to Practice Responsible Development Data book](https://responsibledata.io/ways-to-practise-responsible-development-data/) from the Responsible Data Forum.

The existing training package for ICT4D was fairly dated. I've re-built it from the ground up, relying on the [Digital Principles of Development](http://digitalprinciples.org/) and a couple of activities to get the Volunteers to think about their relationship to ICT4D.

The plans for the future are to build in more media and engaging activities -- but I wanted to get this very simple, straightforward training out to everyone in its simplest form.

This training package can also be [downloaded in its entirety as a PDF](/docs/training-package-ict4d.pdf)

##### Sector(s)

All

# Motivation

- Time: 15 min
- Handout: [ICT4D Overview](/docs/ict4d-overview.pdf)
- Trainer Handout: [ICT experience among Volunteers and their Communities](/docs/trainer-handout-ict-experience-among-volunteers.pdf)
- Handout: [How to Help Someone Use a Computer](/docs/use-a-computer.pdf)

### Reflection on ICT assumptions, awareness, and experiences.

Participants are introduced to the session learning objectives and reflect on the value of their prior ICT experiences.

1. Direct participants’ attention to the learning objectives, and introduce Information and Communications Technology (ICT4D) as an initiative of Peace Corps.

2. Experience/exposure to ICT activity.

	In this activity, you will ask participants about their personal experiences with ICT to help them get a sense of their differences from individuals in their community. Even if they are not technology experts, they might have a lot more experience with ICT than they realize.
	
	Spend a moment here debriefing about particular assumptions and experiences that Volunteers take for granted in their exposure to ICT. Cite the ‘How to Help Someone Use a Computer’ Handout which frames these assumptions well.
	
	In part 2, have participants also use this opportunity to discuss particular skill sets in their cohort – this can be valuable later when they have specific ICT-related questions and issues.

3. Debrief the activity and its purpose with the following points:

	Discuss typical experience levels with ICT in their host communities and how the technologies might be different, but some goals might be the same (or where they are different).
	
	Discuss how community members will likely view Volunteers as “skilled” or “experienced” in ICT and ask for and accept help from them.
	
	Remind participants that they were standing when their community members would likely have been sitting, and thus they truly do have knowledge, experience, and skills, just due to living in an environment that uses ICT regularly, that may be useful in their communities.
	
	“The purpose of this activity was to remind you how those with less experience will view those with more experience and look for their help. Remember that relative to many members of your communities, you will be perceived as much more experienced. And many of these areas we just discussed – email, websites, particular software – might be issues they will want help with—regardless of your sector or stated area of expertise”

4. Reiterate that they have already learned which participants in their group are knowledgeable resources for ICT topics.

	“You’ve also just seen who in your group is more experienced in areas you might need help with. During service, remember the resources that are your fellow Volunteers and utilize them.”

5. Point out other resources for the Volunteers.

	“In addition, you can find help online with the global Peace Corps ICT4D community, as well as guides, toolkits, and links to more specific resources, as well as resources available in the IRC.

	Post Adaptation:
	
	Direct participants’ attention to the list of ICT Committee members (and if any are in attendance, introduce them as such) so Volunteers know some of the resources available to them. Similarly introduce the IT Specialist if she/he can help them. What can the IT Specialist assist Volunteers with?

# Information 1

- Time: 20 min
- Handout: [Anchor Areas](/docs/ict4d-anchor-areas.pdf)

### Why ICT4D?

Participants are introduced to the bigger picture of ICT in the role of Development and how it might play a role in their service.

1. Why is ICT a priority in this country – what are the opportunities being addressed? Why will Volunteers’ ICT experience benefit community members, community organizations, and the community as a whole?

	“The Peace Corps will strengthen host country KSAs with ICT. As a result, host country community members will have greater opportunity and capacity to learn, communicate, participate in local, regional, national and global discussions, get a job, expand businesses, and access resources, etc...”

2. Distribute one copy of Anchor Areas to each participant.

3. Present the Anchor Areas individually, briefly discussing the description.

4. Highlight some of the ICT areas of work (i.e., radio, cellphones, mapping and GIS, computer education, web development, etc) and some of the better examples of how to integrate ICT into Volunteer activities or offer ICT assistance.

# Practice

- Time: 30 min

1. In pairs or groups, have them develop a scenario where they would use the ICT4D Anchor Areas in a project in their site.

2. Have participants work together to develop their scenario (20 minutes).
Emphasize that it doesn’t have to be realistic or detailed, just that they are thinking about integration of ICT. Move around the room to provide assistance as needed.

3. When participants have finished, have them report to the group briefly their scenario.
Remind the participants to be brief; they will have an opportunity to expand on their scenario to the group. This is just to get a summary idea of what each group is working on.

# Information 2

- Time: 10 minutes
- Handout: [Principles of Digital Development](/docs/digital-principles.pdf)

### Principles of Digital Development

Participants are introduced to the broad Principles of digital development and ICT for Development. This acts both as a framework for project management and also a checklist for new project development.

1. Call on participants to read out the principles and then in their own words to suggest why it might be important and appropriate in their work as a Peace Corps Volunteer.

2. Discuss any specific issues that arise – items that are missing from the list, what makes them particularly suited to digital projects, etc.

# Application

- Time: 40 minutes

### Integrating ICT into Peace Corps projects

In the same small groups, participants use the Principles as a checklist for their ICT activity scenario.

1. Ask groups to respond to each principle as if it were a checklist for their scenario. How might they respond to each principle for their scenario.

2. When everyone has finished, have each group present their scenario to the larger group.
Ensure that all groups address the following:
	- Description of the project. For example,
		- who (a role or a specific person) they would work with, o what type of project it would be,
		- what benefits should come from the project,
		- who would benefit from the project, and
		- how this project fulfills the goals of Peace Corps.
	
	- Overall objective of the project/activity (*without* using technology – remember that it’s not about using phone, it’s about communication. It’s not about using a
computer, it’s about learning English, etc.)
	- Specific advantage of ICT in which this ICT intervention is a tool (a more efficient
way) of achieving that objective that what is currently done.
	- Challenges in implementing the scenario (lack of Internet, lack of electricity, local
know-how, basic digital literacy, time, etc.)
	- Two principles that should be addressed as high-priority when planning to carry out this intervention (privacy and security, sustainability, etc.)

3. Finally, if possible, provide examples of how Volunteers incorporated ICT into diverse project areas, especially examples that overcame the challenges mentioned and addressed the principles discussed from above.
	
	If Volunteer members of the ICT4D Committee are in attendance, ask them to share real-life vignettes; otherwise, recount stories of Volunteer projects, either from Volunteers directly or from the VRT.

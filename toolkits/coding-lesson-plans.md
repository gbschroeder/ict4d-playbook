title: Coding Lesson Plans

---

Learning how to code isn't simply something that is reserved for future engineers and computer scientists. People all around the world can benefit from learning even a little bit more about how computers work, how programs operate, and they can take more advantage of the digital landscape before them -- regardless of geography, education, background, gender, or age!

Combined with a broader understanding of [digital literacy](/digital-literacy/), learning how to code and program computers can benefit students and communities in a number of ways. It teaches individuals how to problem-solve, how to think critically and analytically, how to ask questions, how to work in teams, and maybe most important of all, how to be creative and have fun with technology!

## Different types of coding

In order to maximize your time, we are preparing materials that you can use in a variety of circumstances. The goals are as follows:

- **Introduction** to coding for students and youth with zero background in computers and little access to them (either due to devices or bandwidth circumstances).
- **Introduction** to coding in the context of GLOW camps, STEM camps, youth clubs, and conferences.
- **Intermediate** coding for community members and students that allow them to move beyond simple exposure to more robust (and challenging) projects and qualifications.
- **Advanced** coding for those who are looking to build apps, websites, and applications, enter contests (like the [Technovation Challenge](http://www.technovationchallenge.org/?page=1)), and consider computer science as a potential for employability.


## Hour of Code

Volunteer groups in posts all around the world are working to give an 'official' push for all volunteers to participate in the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/), and can occur anytime (though there is a big during [Computer Science Education Week](https://csedweek.org/), every December.)

In December 2015 alone, there were a little over 6,000 events being held in PC countries.[^1] The materials are written at a level such that even Volunteers who aren't themselves incredibly comfortable with technology and computer programming could handle it.

One idea is to create an "Hour of Code Mentoring Project" where our goals would be:

1. to expose as many kids as we can to computer programming and
2. help our counterparts learn how to be mentors to their peers to create more "Hour of Code" events.

## Tips for running coding workshops and sessions with your students

In December, I was able to chat with Andrew Snyder (Thailand), to get tips that he would give to other Volunteers interested in hosting coding sessions.

> For non English speaking countries, it is very useful to create a small cheat sheet of the block codes (in English) with a local language translation. This might require you to work one on one with someone who can help you out, but even PCVs who have just arrived at site should be able to get through it.(edited)

> Related to that, this is an excellent opportunity to create a mini English lesson plan. use those words on the cheat sheet and have the participants practice/recognizing the English before jumping into the programming

> Also, keep in mind the mathematics behind the code and logic. a few of the puzzles required figuring out angles and basic geometric shapes. if you are in a school, bring in the math teacher to help review.

> The other debate that often comes up around the language stuff is how much to translate versus how much folks should be learning “English Programming” to better prepare them for future coding things. I think with younger kids this is probably less of an issue.

> Also, for the most part, in my opinion, we are more interested in getting the kids excited, problem solving and possibly leadership. English is a part, but not the focus, at least as i am using it.

> Initially i didn't want the kids to bother watching the videos that came with the program, because its all English and kinda intimidating, BUT i think that was a mistake bc they do show examples and how to build the code in the "workspace" so even if they don't understand the words, seeing the example is still more useful

> Speaking of leadership, initially i worked with a few students in my village (4th and 5th grade) who came over last Saturday. i was able to work in a small group with them and help them understand and also get that cheat sheet ready. these kids then became my peer leaders when i did the same activity at their school and again when kids come to my house.

> I think getting other teachers involved would be beneficial, particularly math teachers bc of the geometry component.

> The short English description sometimes gives clues, but I used it as a way for the student to use some basic math concepts. for example, one puzzle had the shape repeated 3 times. so i had the students take 360 (full circle) and divide by 3 (for the total number of shapes evenly spaced). from that they were able to figure out the angle. later on the shapes were repeated more times, so we used the same math concept. 360 divided by total number of shapes to get the degrees

> Working in teams seemed to be beneficial as well. they could kind of talk out the situation if something didn't work. I had one group today surprise me by finishing by themselves and then moved to help their friends. when i see these students in English class, they are very quiet, but today they figured out what needed to be done and then helped their friends. I was really surprised.

> One last lesson learned for now, the certificate at the end can be printed to use as a great conclusion, but they don't like non western characters. our fix was to just save a blank certificate (we used a single SPACE as the name) and we will print them out and handwrite the students names.

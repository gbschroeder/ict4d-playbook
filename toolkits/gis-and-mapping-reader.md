# Introduction

Welcome, cartography nerds! Our purpose here is to provide a basic overview and links to resources to get you started in GIS and mapping during your service as a Peace Corps Volunteer (and beyond).

It's important to remember that this field can be absolutely **HUGE** and sometimes overwhelming. Don't be discouraged! There are many points of entry, and even a little knowledge in this stuff can go a long way to making your projects more effective, transparent, and sustainable. So hopefully there's something for everyone here, and this toolkit can help you to level-up your mapping skills.

Without further ado, let's get started!

First, some definitions.



##### What is GIS?

Up first—A GIS (Geospatial [or Geographic] Information System) system is 'designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data ([wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)).

When we talk about GIS, we could be referring to the academic discipline, the collection of software and platforms, processes, or even simply data that has a spatial component. Context matters here in determining which one is being discussed. Also, you'll sometimes see 'GIS' and 'Mapping' thrown around interchangeably. For our purposes in this toolkit, they are interchangeable, so try not to get hung up on them.



##### What are maps?

Second—Maps. What are maps? OK, that's actually going to be a tough one, and it's a little outside of the scope here to define. Suffice it to say, this toolkit is basically going to refer to [awesome maps like this](http://americangeo.org/map-links/):

![World Map](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/5032/products/World_Maps_International_20mil_1.jpg?v=1413619116)
*Don't be tempted by the neo-colonial legacy hegemony of the oft-used [Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection). This is Peace Corps.*

But when we talk about GIS, we're not simply talking about political maps that have different colors for different countries that are neatly labeled and agreed upon.

We could be talking about specific parts of the world zoomed in from countries, even down to specific neighborhoods and addresses. It's not just labels of place names, but can be things like shapes of rivers, lakes, and mountains (topography), boundaries of areas that might include data on land ownership or voting districts (sometimes called polygons or shapes), and points of interest or dots where interesting things occur (points), as well as images overlaid on top of these maps that might show temperatures of hot spots or satellite imagery.

Phew.

Oh, and it's not just in two-dimensions (could be three or even four!), and it might not be static like a map on a wall, but dynamic like a map that lets you zoom in and out and select different layers of interest. Oh, now that I've mentionned 'layers'...



##### Show me the Layers

Before your mind explodes, just try to digest this image. The amazing thing about maps, mapping, GIS, and computers these days is that we can put all of these things together in new and interesting ways.

We can see relationships and data presented to us in a way that allows us to see new connections, gain new insights, and monitor important situations.

This great image below shows how these pieces *can* fit together to combine data into something that could be really interesting ([image source](http://www.co.ontario.ny.us/index.aspx?NID=1176)).

![GIS Data Layers](http://www.co.ontario.ny.us/images/pages/N1176/gisdata.jpg)



##### How to think about GIS for Volunteer projects

Now that your mind has hopefully been blown a little bit, let's roll up our sleeves. How in the heck can you use maps in your projects? The most important piece of advice that I can give would be to think of GIS and mapping as **the thing that allows you to do the thing**, they aren't the thing itself....

...huh?



##### Do GIS projects by not starting with GIS tools

Basically this just means that you should think of GIS and mapping as tools to achieve your objectives as a Peace Corps Volunteer first, not simply as the solution that's going to magically solve things for you. One helpful exercise before even beginning to sort through the links and resources below is to define what you're wanting to do *without* invoking technology or mapping. Why do this? One, because it helps to ensure you've got a clearly articulated objective laid out ahead of you. Two, it's actually kind of difficult.

An example of this -- maybe you want to "create a map of all the bednets that are distributed within my community." Great! But let's think about this -- why do we want to create a map of this? What are we missing?

"...so that we can see where there are unequal distributions of the nets and correct for that on an ongoing basis..." Better, but not perfect. Maps don't do that magically -- we need to think about the data behind the map, and connect that to the lessons learned from that, and connect these two with our mapping platform as the vehicle to move us from point A to point B.

"Our team would like to correct for unequal distributions of bednets across our community in as real-time as possible." Ahhh. Doesn't that feel better? We know what we want, and we know what success is. NOW, we just get to add the tool that we'll use to achieve that -- "...by using an easily accessible and editable web-map..."



##### Moving forward with confidence

This is a great start. But it also should just be the beginning. As with any project like this, you'll also want to consider things like designing with your users in mind, using open-standards, addressing privacy and security of the data, and how you're going to make this project sustainable and not simply a one-off that looks oh so cool on your DOS (Description Of Service). Lots more on this here and in other toolkits.

But enough talk -- let's check out some of these resources! Remember that they are works in progress, and new stuff is coming down the pike every single day. Help to contribute to this toolkit (or any of the ICT4D Playbook Toolkits) by checking out the Contributing page. We need your help!

- [State of the Map 2015](http://stateofthemap.us/program/) -- All of the talks and threads of the US Government involvement in OpenStreetMap in particular. See our very own [Courtney Clark discuss Peace Corps and OSM](http://stateofthemap.us/osm-in-peace-corps/)!



### Readings on GIS in International Development

- [Social Media, Crisis Mapping and the New Frontier of Disaster Response](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/08/social-media-microtasking-disaster-response) -- Nice little overview of crisis mapping.

- [Why GeoMapping is worth a Thousand Words](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/01/19/why-good-geo-mapping-is-worth-a-thousand-words/) -- Great defense of mapping from Taryn Davis of Development Gateway.



### Readings on GIS in Government

- [USAID Welcomes the Crowd to Use Geo-Mapping Tools for Open Source Development](http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/01/usaid-welcomes-the-crowd-to-use-geo-mapping-tools-for-open-source-development/) -- Delightful overview from a government agency that's gotten out ahead on this stuff. "OpenStreetMap and Field Papers is changing the way USAID does business by freely sharing open source mapping programs and bringing in the global community to help solve local problems."

- [Shadrok Roberts on Crowdsourcing at USAID & Geodata (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B9RUdDn3xA) -- TED-esque style talk by former USAID geodata guru (Shadrok is now at [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com)) detailing a project to get crowds to fill in the blanks on messy geospatial data. Peace Corps can learn from this example, yeah?

- [Slumdog mapmakers fill in the urban blanks](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429924.100-slumdog-mapmakers-fill-in-the-urban-blanks.html?full=true#.VGgPd5PF-0s) -- Defense of open-mapping from the point of view of ground-truthing the poverty situation.

# Technologies



### Cloud-based GIS and Mapping Platforms

- [Google Maps](maps.google.com) -- The industry standard right now. Has directions, ability to add custom layers/point, Street View, and a bunch of other things. Also has apps with more and more increased (and offline) functionality for smartphones.

- [OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org) -- Open-source map created by community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world. Check out the [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) for more information.

- [Here Maps](https://www.here.com/) -- Road-centric maps. Built by a consortium of car manufacturers -- the offline apps are really great.



### Software and Platforms

- [ESRI - ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) -- The industry-standard in GIS software and solutions. Better with enterprise accounts, but you're able to do a trial version to make interested layered maps on their ArcGIS Online platform. The suite of ESRI tools is pretty expansive, ranging from consumer-level items like their smartphone apps all the way up to enterprise-level server platforms. If you're getting involved in GIS, you've no doubt heard this name, especially with respect to ArcGIS Desktop. Last update it was still PC-only. But if you're looking for the closest open-source equivalent to ArcGIS Desktop, I would recommend QGIS.

- [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) -- Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. Basically compares to ArcGIS Desktop (with even a few bells and whistles added). It's a little *less* user friendly, and it's more-or-less a standalone GIS solution (it won't host the content or provide you raw datasets). Check out the tutorials to level up on this if you're ready to move past looking at OpenStreetMap layers. Also has Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available.

	- [QGIS Tutorials and Tips](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/) -- Great documentation from the QGIS team.

	- [QGIS Walkthrough (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0r1GNTT-0o) -- Video introduction from the TechChange team to QGIS.

	- [QGIS Interactive Tutorial from Harvard](http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/) -- A little dated but still good tutorial walking through the QGIS interface.



### Browser-based GIS Services

- [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) -- Browser-based mapping and analysis of location data.

- [CartoDB Map Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/) -- Learn how to create maps on the web and visualize geospatial data using CartoDB.

- [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/) -- Pick from a dozen beautifully designed maps and create an application from it in just a few seconds. Great for creating visually appealing maps from preexisting or pre-cleaned data. Also has iOS, Android, and mobile web versions.

- [Mapbox Studio - Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) -- Design studio to create stunning interactive maps (formerly TileMill).

- [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/) -- Toner, terrain, and watercolor maps, free for the taking.

- [Dropchop.io](http://dropchop.io/) -- Browser-based GIS powered by Mapbox.js and Turf.js

- [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) -- A web-based platform for mapping information from reports from SMS, Twitter, e-mail, and web. Initially used to map election violence and intimidation in Kenya.



### OpenStreetMap (OSM)

There's a lot to say about the crowd-sourced and open platform of OpenStreetMap. And others have done so much better than I can, including our own Courtney Clark. Definitely check out the [OSM-flavored Mapping Toolkit](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/mapping-toolkit) for more info!

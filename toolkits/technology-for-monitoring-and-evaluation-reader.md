# Introduction

These are just a few of the ways that we see Volunteers using ICTs in these ways.

- **Diagnosis**—ICTs help bring new voices and broader participation into program diagnosis and enable a wider range of inputs at a reduced cost. They enable evaluators to better manage and pull possible trends out of large data sets.             
- **Planning**—ICTs can help achieve greater inclusion in planning processes. New technologies make it easier to compare and visualize data sets and to analyze data based on location so that resources can be better allocated. Data can also be aggregated more quickly and shared at various levels to improve participation in the planning process and support better decisions. New software tools can enhance the development and management of theories of change.
- **Implementation and monitoring**—ICTs allow for the collection of real-time data on participant experiences, behaviors and attitudes, meaning that analysis can be conducted early on in the process and course corrections can be made to improve interventions and outcomes. Direct feedback from program participants is also possible through new ICTs, which can allow for greater transparency and accountability.
- **Evaluation**—ICTs can increase the voice of vulnerable and underrepresented groups and broaden the types and volume of data that can be collected, combined, compared and analyzed. New technologies may be able to help overcome challenges and constraints such as sample bias and poor data quality, and they can improve the understanding of complex sets of behavior and data.
- **Reporting, sharing and learning**—ICTs enable wider circulation of evaluative learning, interactive sharing and greater public engagement with evaluation findings.



### So, you want to use mobile data collection...

Mobile data collection allows Peace Corps Volunteers to adopt a real-time, feedback-oriented, documented approach to their projects and activities. It enables our service to be oriented towards impact, and for our Volunteers to become better development professionals.

There are some important caveats to note as you read this toolkit, and these will change as the toolkit evolves and Peace Corps' approach towards M&E improves over time.

**First**—no single Peace Corps office, personnel role or title, manual, process, framework, or working group speaks for all things M&E. The responsibility of intelligent approaches towards data, project management, feedback cycles, implementation, and reporting require expertise and insight from many different domains of knowledge and experience. It's easy to be overwhelmed by the intracacies of software, logframes, project frameworks, data integrity, the VRT, etc. **Don't be overwhelmed! There are folks all around you who are willing to help!**

**Second**—in the same vein, mobile tech **does not** equal a mobile VRF/VRT. This comes up time and time again, "well, just make the VRF mobile and we don't need to think about this anymore..." Sadly, it's not that simple. Happily, it's useful to think of opportunities to use technologies (or ICTs more generally) in our Peace Corps work as akin 'The Force' like in Star Wars. "...it surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds us together." And it can also be used well and in strategic, simplified ways, or can be complex, complicated, and created by the Empire (the analogy falls apart a little at the end. But just barely.)

**Third**—it should never be about the technology. Even when thinking about something data-heavy and complicated like mobile data collection, you should always take a step back and remember that **technology isn't the thing**, it's **the thing that allows you to do the thing**.



### Problems and solutions as external from the technology

This just means that you should think of your technology as a tool to achieve your objective (and indirectly your outcome) as a Peace Corps Volunteer first. It's not simply the magical solution that's going to solve things for you by involving an app.

One helpful exercise before even beginning to sort through the links and resources below is to define what you're wanting to do *without* invoking the technology. Why do this? One, because it helps to ensure you've got a clearly articulated objective laid out ahead of you. Two, it's actually kind of difficult.

An example of this -- maybe you want to "create a map of all the bednets that are distributed within my community." Great! But let's think about this -- why do we want to create a map of this? What are we missing?

"...so that we can see where there are unequal distributions of the nets and correct for that on an ongoing basis..." Better, but not perfect. Maps don't do that magically -- we need to think about the data behind the map, and connect that to the lessons learned from that, and connect these two with our mapping platform as the vehicle to move us from point A to point B.

"Our team would like to correct for unequal distributions of bednets across our community in as real-time as possible." Ahhh. Doesn't that feel better? We know what we want, and we know what success is. NOW, we just get to add the tool that we'll use to achieve that -- "...by using an easily accessible and editable web-map that is informed by a database that is updated by data entry via mobile data collection..."

Remember, it's not all apps and forms and photos and GPS coordinates. At the end of the day, what Peace Corps wants, what we've always wanted, is to be good ambassadors to our communities, for our communities, and to provide value in our service (goals 2,3, and 1, respectively.)



# The Mobile Data Mindset



### There are right and wrong ways to do data collection, and especially mobile data collection.

Just because something is an app doesn't mean that it's going to work, that someone should use it, or that you should build a program around it. It's important to really think through your project, your approach, and your resource, *prior* to launching a full-scale mobile M&E (monitoring & evaluation) effort. Furthermore, there can be real costs and risks associated with collecting data -- even something that might be perceived at first glance as innocuous. Even demographic data such as a name, a person's gender, or where they're from can represent sensitive data that must if leaked or released could put that persons life or family in jeopardy.

> There are tradeoffs in everyhing, and no solution is perfect.

Sometimes a smart-phone app is not the way to go on a project (for lots of reasons). Maybe one platform is more user friendly but costs more, whereas another platform is free but is incredidbly clunky to build on.



### Custom-built or out-of-the-box

An important consideration that one should be thinking about here is the extent to which platforms/apps/systems can be customized or tailored to fit our purposes. It's reasonable to think that if Peace Corps has actually bought/built something, then we should be able to extend or repurpose that thing to suit our needs in a cost-effective manner. And this is absolutely true. You should adopt a 'start where you are, use what you have, do what you can' approach. But be warned that just because something *can* do something does not mean that you should build your project around that platform's abilitity to actually *do* that thing. There are always tradeoffs involved, and it might well be that your customization at the end of the day requires significantly more investment than simply 'buying something off the shelf.'

Case in point -- Microsoft SharePoint is used by a lot of organizations to manage company intranets. Peace Corps is one of them. Can it be said that SharePoint can collect data? Yes. Can it work on a smartphone? Technically, yes. Can you set up forms, permissions, and different workspaces for different groups? Yes, yes, and yes. So it's perfect, right? Not exactly. There's not a single major international development organization that I know of that uses SharePoint as a back-end for their data collection. Why not? Simple -- it wasn't built to do that. While those answers are all technically yes, the hypothetical and the reality of those 'yes'es are crossed only by an ocean of deep investments in time, money, and effort.

Also remember that there are similar systems to think about but aren't built for mobile data collection per se, but that you might hear about within a Peace Corps context. So a line of questioning around tradeoffs should be going through your mind anytime someone at Peace Corps says, "Well can't we just do what you want with..." and they say: "VRF, VRT, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft CRM, PCLive, PCMedics, VLMT, Tableau, Drupal, Wordpress, Moodle, Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Google Sheets, Google Forms, BaseCamp, Trello, SalesForce, SMS or text messaging, Facebook (I've heard this), Yammer (this one too), And countless others...)

So, what **are** the questions you should ask? There are many. Take a deep breath...



# Mobile Data Collection Questions

There's no **ONE** solution here, but here's a few concepts to get you started...



##### 1. Operating system(s)

- Is it only on Android, only on Apple devices (iOS)?
- Only text-based (SMS)?
- Only a computer (Mac or PC)?

##### 2. The data collector

- Is this something that Volunteers themselves will enter?
- Their community?
- Open on the Internet?
- What will the instructions be?
- Will there be training?

##### 3. Initial designs and configurations

- Will the design and administration of the platform be web-based?
- Is it intuitive? Is it drag-and-drop or more complicated?
- What are the tradeoffs in terms of easy-of-development versus complexity (conditionals and skip-logic make things easy for an end-user (maybe), but they can wonky to set-up, especially for the uninitiated.)

##### 4. Components of collection?

- Will you need GPS coordinators?
- Will you require photos, audio, and/or video?
- Will you want to *limit* those options?
- Will everyone have the right hardware and technical equipment?
- Will variations affect the data collection model?

##### 5. Type(s) of data

- Thinking about text, free paragraphs of information versus rigid categories that have been agreed upon beforehand?
- Will there be other data validation techniques, either within the app or via a project coordinator?

##### 6. Training and rollout

- Will the process be intuitive? Will there be helper text? Will this affect the platform selected?
- Is this a data collection app, or actually more of a learning and coaching app?

##### 7. Bandwidth

- Will you need the Internet?
- Will you be able to store things offline? Where?
- What will the setup be required for a web-server or cloud-based approach?

##### 8. Costs

- Think of both the obvious ones (platform, tech support, hours invested by Volunteers/staff) but also the hidden costs such as the time it would take to interview your community members to get the data, how long it will take to collect, analyze, - report, and communicate back to your community, etc.
- Also -- what are the various costs associated with proprietary data systems and organizations that would suffer from 'lock-- in'?

##### 9. Administration

- Will there be a single administrator or a team? How are they decided, and how does the platform account for differences?
- How would it handle multiple ownership levels so that Volunteers, staff, and HQ folks know what data they can/cannot see/modify?

##### 10. Data formats

- Is this an all-in-one platform that has a smartphone app, a web-interface, and desktop application?
- Does the data collection only represent a part of the data landscape that is needed here, and separate solutions must be found for data storage, analysis, and communication?
- Does this platform offer many different usable formats such as Excel, CSV, database, and API functionalities?
Is the intention to integrate this platform with other platforms? With platforms even at HQ?

##### 11. Security and confidentiality

- What are the risks of this data being leaked? Worst-case scenarios and likely scenarios.
- What are the various policy and legal implications for not only the data, but the servers, organizations, and pieces of software involved?

##### 12. User Experience

- What will be the interface for data entry?
- How simply/complex will it be?
- Will it be an improvement upon existing systems? Will it be *enough* of an improvement to convince stakeholders and data collectors to switch over?
- Is this mandatory or optional, and what are the consequeneces of either path?

If this is overwhelming, that's ok! This isn't easy. We are talking about the intersections of international development, technology, and government. I hope you weren't thinking that would be easy. Alas, there are many organizations to learn from, and many efforts have been underway for years that we can learn from. To start you on your journey, I would recommend these starter apps and platforms (not exhaustive by any means, but a good start to see tradeoffs):



# The Platforms and Apps

*All of these apps below are 'freemium' unless otherwise stated. This means that they basically will have free plans for most users, but your options will be limited to some degree (number of users, number of forms, export functionality, built-in sms, support, that sort of thing)*

- [Magpi](http://home.magpi.com/) -- iOS, Android  app (SMS on the Pro plan). I like their drag-and-drop builder and web-review of data entries.

- [Commcare](https://www.commcarehq.org/home/) -- Android-only, but don't let that stop you. One of the best web interfaces out there, some of the best training on their [CommCare Academy](http://learn.commcarehq.org/) site, and have worked with Peace Corps in the past (they have many RPCVs on staff). The interface is a bit clunky on the web, and it's difficult for folks to start from scratch if you don't have a programming background. Notable organizations using this include Save the Children and the WHO.

- [iFormBuilder](https://www.iformbuilder.com/) -- iOS, Android, and SMS app. Many options for data types, and does well with multiemedia. Fair documentation, and not too clunky an interface (given how complex you can make it). I love the API and data types functionality (API only on pro accounts). This is my current all around favorite. Notable organizations using it include Mercy Corps and PSI.

- [DataWinners](https://www.datawinners.com/) -- Android-only, slick drag-and-drop interface on the web. Plus, the creator is an Africa RPCV. I also love this organization because they're originally based out of Madagascar, which is where I served.

- [TaroWorks](https://www.taroworks.org/) -- Android-only, built on the Salesforce platform and originally designed for project management purposes. I haven't played with this one a ton.

- [ViewWorld](http://www.viewworld.net/) -- iOS and Android. Slick and familiar interface (Bootstrap, for you nerds). It's got good user group controls and sub-items (or sub-forms), and good data validation (by a manager or coordinator on the back-end). No "logic" functions. Organizations using it include CARE and the Danish Red Cross.

- [Epicollect](http://www.epicollect.net/) (and [Epicollect+](http://www.plus.epicollect.net/)) -- iOS and Android (though EpiCollect+ is Android-only). Actually a pretty slick setup, and paid for by the Imperial College London so it really is free and open-source. Uses the Google App Engine as the back-end, so some assembly required (the cost of free). Organizations using it include FAO.

- [Kobotoolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) -- Drag-and-drop interface, built on top of [ODK](https://opendatakit.org/) and [Enketo](https://enketo.org/) (web forms). I haven't played with it that much, to be honest. Organizations using it include USAID, IRC, 

- [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) -- Android-only. Use [Build](https://opendatakit.org/use/build/) or [XLSForm](https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/) to create the survey form, [Collect](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/) to fill-in the survey, and then [Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) to host the survey results. Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but it's the cost of the actual free thing that underlies a lot of these other platforms out there.

- [POIMapper](http://www.poimapper.com/) -- iOS and Android, fairly straightfoward but focused on maps (POI is Point Of Interest).

- [Tangerine - EGRA](http://www.tangerinecentral.org/projects/egra) -- Electronic data collection software designed for use on mobile computers, including netbooks, tablet computers and smartphones. Its primary use is to enable recording of students’ responses in oral early grade reading and mathematics skills assessments, specifically Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA), and interview responses from students, teachers and principals on home and school context information.

- [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com/) -- Web-based platform for forms. Can also be integrated into other platforms.

...and many more...

seriously.

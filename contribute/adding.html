title: Adding a page
---

<p class="lead">Most of what you need to know to add a new page is covered under ‘<a href="{{ "/contribute/editing/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Editing a page</a>’, so make sure you have first read through that section.</p>

<p>Adding a page follows a similar process to editing. Instead of locating your page, your first step is to locate your new page’s parent directory.</p>

<h2>1: Create the page</h2>

<p>First locate the parent directory, or folder, in which your file will live. If you are adding a page to the Toolkits, for example, you should be in the '<strong>templates</strong>' directory, where you’ll see a list of all the Toolkit pages.</p>

<p>Above the list of pages is a breadcrumb trail <code>{{ site.github_repo }} / toolkits /</code>, to the right of which is a plus symbol <code><strong>+</strong></code>. Click the plus symbol to create your new page.</p>

<h2>2: Name your file</h2>

<p>You should now have a new file editor page open. The first editable section you are presented with is the ‘<em>Name your file</em>’ field. As we touched upon when looking at <a href="{{ "/contribute/editing/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">editing files</a>, the file name corresponds to the URL of the page on the site. There are a few of rules to follow here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file name should reflect the title of the new page</li>
  <li>Must be unique</li>
  <li>Should be all lowercase</li>
  <li>Words should be separated by hyphens (-)</li>
  <li>File name should end with the extension '<em>.md</em>' (the .md extension indicates a markdown file)</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, if you were creating a page titled '<em>My Cool Page</em>', you would use a file name of:</p>

<pre>
<code>my-cool-page.md</code>
</pre>

<p>Assuming you are creating this in the '<em>toolkit</em>' directory, this would result in a URL of <em>{{ site.url }}/toolkit/my-cool-page</em></p>

<div class="note">
  <h6>Note</h6>
  <p>The actual words used in your file name are not crucial. It’s fine to use a more succinct version of your page title, for example.</p>
</div>

<h2>3: Formatting your content</h2>

<p>This step is the same as when editing a page. You need to start your file with the Front Matter, then add your content, formatting it using Markdown. Here is a template to get you started:</p>

<pre>
<code>---
title: My Cool Page
authors:
 - Fred Bloggs
---

##A large introductory paragraph.

Regular paragraphs, separated by empty lines.

###A heading

Another paragraph.

 * Maybe
 * a
 * list</code>
</pre>

<p>When you’re done, click ‘<em>Propose new file</em>’.</p>

<h2>4: Make a pull request</h2>

<p>Once you have created your page(s) and updated the contents document, you're ready to make your pull request. Click the pull request icon to the right of the screen <code class="icon-git-pull-request"><span>[git pull-request icon]</span></code>, then click ‘<em>New pull request</em>’.</p>

<p>You should now be able to see listed below, all the changes that you wish to contribute. If everything looks as it should, click ‘<em>Create pull request</em>’.</p>

<p>Give your pull request a title and description, then click ‘<em>Create pul request</em>’. You have now contributed your pages to the Playbook! :)</p>

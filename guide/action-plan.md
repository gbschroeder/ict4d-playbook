### Approaches for a robust ICT4D Strategy and Rollout

- **Knowledge**: Peace Corps is managing our in-house expertise and ICT4D talent to support retention, learning, knowledge exchange, and technical assistance.
- **Portfolio**: We are assembling and organizing a  portfolio of field-proven ICT4D solutions that can be quickly and easily adapted to the need of individual projects and communities, scaled, and sustained over time.
- **Processes**: We are implementing and continuously improving standard processes for ICT4D project management and integration with all country and program frameworks.
- **Advisory Services**: We are tying it all together by promoting  advisory services which uses Peace Corps’ ICT4D network to build on the experience of colleagues, leverage the ICT4D portfolio, and develop ICT4D solution implementation plans that embody best practices.

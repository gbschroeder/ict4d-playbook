> If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

It's not simply about putting phones in the hands of Volunteers or promoting e-readers as 'magic bullets' for literacy education in their classrooms.

The Peace Corps approach in ICT4D is to train Volunteers on how to think about technological interventions themselves within the context of their communities. Over time, both the Volunteers themselves, Peace Corps Posts, and Headquarters staff have begun to develop a set of guiding principles in T4D from the perspective of Volunteers:

In a perfect world, ICTs should be the unsung hero—the invisible catalyst—of social and economic development. They should recede into the background of any intervention, allowing for the people, the change, and the solution to emerge as the essential ingredients to the social good endeavor.

### The Peace Corps Niche

Peace Corps Volunteers are able to have the most impact when they operate at the intersection of national priorities and resources, community priorities and assets, and the Volunteers’ own knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

Recognizing that particular roles and projects are going to be more easily accessible and achievable by Volunteers is key to the Peace Corps having the as much an impact as possible.

## Tailoring adaptive solutions for every environment

Our Volunteers are deployed into incredibly diverse and varied communities, and while we do focus our training and have a streamlined approach to the types of projects that Volunteers engage in, there are simply too many environments, variables, and differences to prescribe global one-size-fits-all solutions.

What works in one place may not work in another–whether it’s across the globe or just down the road. This context allows us at Peace Corps to think broadly and strategically about how we train our Volunteers in thinking about projects that use mobile technologies.

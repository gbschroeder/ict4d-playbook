title: ICT4D for Peace Corps Volunteers
---

This entire Playbook is built with Volunteers in mind.

Peace Corps Volunteers should be able to quickly browse, search for, and find relevant information and tools to do their jobs -- whatevery they may be.




## Five ways to use ICT4D to maximize your Volunteer service

This page is a quick-start guide to tools and resources that might be most relevant to Volunteers starting out in the Playbook but also for orienting oneself around ICT4D more broadly.



#### 1. Join or create an ICT4D committee at post

Many posts already have formalized and informal (both are ok) committees of Volunteers at your post looking into various ways in which technology, data, information, and communications can play a valuable role for your communities, your counterparts, or your fellow Volunteers.

Don't have one? Then create one. Already have one but the focus is on something different -- so you're interested in social media but the current committee is focused on mapping? Great! Add your voice to the mix and broaden the scope of the group -- you're the Volunteer they've been waiting for.

Also be sure to ask around -- especially your Peace Corps Post Staff -- many times the high turnover of Peace Corps cause committees and groups to wax and wane, but they might have valuable insights and resources -- you just have to ask.

We have joined forces to create this [Starting an ICT4D Committee](/toolkits/starting-an-ict4d-committee/) toolkit page -- be sure to check that out for various tips to get started.



#### 2. Get involved with the Peace Corps global ICT4D communities

We are made more effective the more that we communicate, and this is no more truer than in having dialogues across posts, sectors, and regions of the Peace Corps. Here's just a few areas to get you started -- 

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Playbook](http://playbook.peacecorpsict4d.org) -- Hosts the Playbook, Guide, Program Areas, Toolkits, and Volunteer Projects. You're probably looking at it right now!

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Twitter](https://twitter.com/peacecorpsICT4D) -- Used sparingly (for now?) but if you tweet at us (me?) it might cause me to pick up. : )

- [Peace Corps Technology Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ict4pcv/) -- Strong membership with good involvement, this is the place to post updates to PCVs, RPCVs, etc. Managed by the ICT4D Initiative folks for now.

- [ICT4D Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/FEygL) -- Periodic (about one/week) updates from the PC/Washington ICT4D Initiative folks (me!). Check out the [archived newsletters as well](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=f01e279afc825e8e4c097e001&id=7f5b83c088)

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Hub](http://hub.peacecorpsict4d.org) -- Pilot program of a reddit-like forum (voting, commenting, etc.) for Peace Corps' ICT4D efforts. Open to the public but highly moderated.

- [Peace Corps Community on Slack](https://peacecorpscommunity.slack.com) -- RPCV-run Slack team -- a great place to chat with fellow Volunteers, RPCVs, and partners. You'll [need an invite](http://slack.peacecorpsict4d.org), and right now it's open to all. What is Slack? Think of it like a big chat room for everyone interested in Peace Corps topics -- with built-in 'channels' for #ict4d and everything.

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3_92O4iu-M3fkdpTXpKdzQ2Q2dJQWdkRElGX1dfMzlmMThPTDRSMWVEdHVkeDRwaDh2ZGs) -- Constantly updated collection of shared docs. Doesn't have to be a google doc (spreadsheet, doc) -- but serves as the rough and tumble file repository.



#### 3. Learn and use the [Digital Principles of Development](http://digitalprinciples.org)

ICT4D isn't simply about using technology for its own sake -- we don't need an acronym for that!

Rather, it's about using technologies **effectively** to be more **sustainable**, to have a **local impact**, and to benefit the **communities** that we serve.

To that end, Peace Corps has adopted the nine [Digital Principles](http://digitalprinciples.org), which are also in this [ICT4D Guide with Peace Corps-specific overviews](/guide/principles/):

1. Design with the User
2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem
3. Design for Scale
4. Build for Sustainability
5. Be Data Driven
6. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation
7. Reuse and Improve
8. Address Privacy & Security
9. Be Collaborative



#### 4. Collect, report, and learn from data

Following on from the Principles, it is crucial that we think about impact and data-driven decision-making from the start. It's not enough to simply live the experiences, we have to also be storytellers as facilitators for change.

**First**, think about the how you are collecting feedback, administering your own surveys, conducting design-thinking and PACA sessions, and generally incorporating monitoring & evaluation into your activities.

A good place to get started on this is to check out the Playbook's own [field guide to monitoring & evaluation](/toolkits/field-guide-to-monitoring-and-evaluation/). After that, you may want to check out the [field guide to mobile data collection](/toolkits/field-guide-to-mobile-data-collection/), the [mobile data questions](/toolkits/mobile-data-questions/), and finally the [mobile data platforms and apps](/toolkits/mobile-data-platforms-and-apps/) when you're ready to put the pieces together.

**Second**, you're going to want to think about how to report your findings and analyze your activities.

Obviously you'll be familiar with the Volunteer Reporting Form (VRF) that Posts and Headquarters use to track the various activities of Volunteers at a high level. Yes -- it's not the perfect reporting system (I know. I feel your pain.) As far as ICT4D is concerned -- don't worry about reporting the whole kit & kaboodle along technology lines. The most important things you can do are to:

- check the "**ICT4D**" box for activities where you leverage technologies (be inclusive here, better to be counted even for broad use than not counted at all. No penalties here); and
- use hashtags (**#**) to call out specific subjects, topical areas, technologies, and anything else that has a keyword value. This helps Peace Corps staff identify and sort the key words and phrases that Volunteers highlight. This isn't official policy, by the way -- it's just an incredibly helpful internal hack.

But don't think of the VRF as the be-all-end-all to reporting. That's just the starting point -- you should be open to keeping your own records, your own system, and your own mechanism for tracking your own project success.[^note]



#### 5. Tell your story

I'll be the first to admit that we don't focus enough on storytelling as an integral part of our Peace Corps service projects and experience. I'm not talking simply about blogs and poetry (though these are certainly invaluable), but about being able to convey the challenges your community faces, how you explored them, how you co-created solutions with your counterparts -- what worked, what didn't, where you went for help, etc. These are all critical components in learning from our experiences.

Your Description of Service (DOS) isn't going to be comprehensive, here.

###### Case Studies

I encourage Volunteers to write their experiences as case studies -- with strong problem-solution-methods formats. I don't have a particular model in mind (just yet -- though I'm working on advocating an overall standard). A good example to check out is the [Community Mapping & Micro Planning Project](http://blog.socialcops.com/portfolio/community-mapping-micro-planning-project-264-villages-across-vijayawada) out of India. 

###### [Peace Corps Passport Blog](http://passport.peacecorps.gov)

A good place to post these case studies (or edited versions of them) are the [Passport Blog](http://passport.peacecorps.gov) -- it's a public forum that gets seen by quite a few folks and really helps to convey the effort of Volunteers to a global audience. Plus it's great for posterity and recognition after Peace Corps.

###### [Peace Corps Medium](https://medium.com/@PeaceCorps)

Similar to the Peace Corps Passport, if you're not reading [Medium](https://medium.com/), you really ought to be. It's a great platform that is a great storytelling venue for Volunteers. You don't need to work with Peace Corps HQ to write on Medium, but if you *do* reach out and your writing is up to snuff, you could show up on the [official page](https://medium.com/@PeaceCorps).

###### [Peace Corps ICT4D Blog](http://peacecorpsict4d.org/blog/)

OK -- this doesn't exist yet. But it very well could and should very soon. Keep your eyes peeled for it.

###### Your own blogs and social media

You have all the control over the medium, and this is a great way to craft your message about your experiences. Plus, you can be as detailed and succinct as you want to be (yay!). Be sure to tweet @peacecorpsict4d when you get a blog up and running!

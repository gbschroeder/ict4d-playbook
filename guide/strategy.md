<p class="lead">The Peace Corps ICT4D mission is to mainstream the use of ICT4D solutions to enable Volunteers to be more effective.</p>

As Volunteers listen and learn from their communities, they become facilitators, assistants, mentors, and even leaders. They strive to adapt their skills, experiences, and insights to meaningful efforts defined and shaped by the communities themselves. ICTs comprise the tools and technologies that help them serve their communities with the greatest impact.

These are the three channels or activities that Volunteers engage in at a very high level to support their communities. These activities, in turn, are how Peace Corps staff support the Volunteers. And to extend these cross-cutting activities further, this is how the ICT4D Specialist in Peace Corps Washington supports ICT4D for other Peace Corps staff and Volunteers as well.

## Layers to support ICT4D globally

There are four essential layers that support staff and Volunteers in their ICT4D efforts:

- **Knowledge**: Peace Corps is managing our in-house expertise and ICT4D talent to support retention, learning, knowledge exchange, and technical assistance.
- **Portfolio**: We are assembling and organizing a  portfolio of field-proven ICT4D solutions that can be quickly and easily adapted to the need of individual projects and communities, scaled, and sustained over time.
- **Processes**: We are implementing and continuously improving standard processes for ICT4D project management and integration with all country and program frameworks.
- **Advisory Services**: We are tying it all together by promoting  advisory services which uses Peace Corps’ ICT4D network to build on the experience of colleagues, leverage the ICT4D portfolio, and develop ICT4D solution implementation plans that embody best practices.

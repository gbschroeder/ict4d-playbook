#### 1. Digital Literacy

> Volunteers work to narrow the economic and social inequality in the access to, use of, and/or impact of ICTs in their communities; and to empower everyone through computer, mobile, and digital tools.

All Volunteers are educators in one capacity or another—across all sectors and all countries. As we live in an increasingly digital world, communities (even remote ones) are often keenly aware of the potential benefits to be gained from skill sets associated with computers mobile phones, and the Internet. They are also aware of the risk associated with not being digitally literate for themselves and for their future generations.

There are a number of ways in which Volunteers help their communities to take advantage of digital and technological opportunities, including:

- Basic computer skills in classrooms for students, youth, and adults.
- Intermediate computer and Internet literacy—operating systems, productivity software, web browsers.
- Advanced digital literacy related to library and computer labs, computer programming, media production, and digital responsibility.
- Technology-oriented clubs and camps for youth that incorporate ICTs into life-skills, youth development, and other sectoral areas.

> #### Sidebox: What is the Digital Divide?

> The rapid diffusion of technologies around the world—of computers and mobile phones, of opportunities around tech-related jobs and careers, and of access to on-demand services and information—has not necessarily benefitted everyone.

> The gulf between the technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ has been called the ‘Digital Divide’ — the social and economic inequality that exists with regards to the access to, use of, or impact of ICTs.

> The Digital Divide is not just the inequality between rich and poor countries — it is the gap in geography, in status, in generation , in race, and in gender. If there’s limited understanding about how it all works, these new users will likely miss out.

> Our role is to act as catalysts to bridge this divide; to build on the existing historical and market forces that have led to the amazing diffusion of technology and innovation and ensure that it can benefit as many lives as possible.

#### 2. ICTs in Education

> Volunteers leverage ICTs to contribute to universal access to education, equity in education, the delivery of quality learning and teaching, teachers’ professional development and more efficient education management, governance and administration.

Education is the largest sector of work for Peace Corps Volunteers, comprising nearly half of the entire Volunteer Corps.
Half of all ICT4D-related activities (approx. 1,717) were focused in schools (the other beneficiaries included Community Centers, Cooperatives / Associations, Government Offices, Health Centers, NGOs, and Private Businesses).

A focus on education through the lens of ICTs facilitates access to educational services, improves teacher capability to deliver those services, and strengthens education system capacity.

#### 3. Technology in Monitoring & Evaluation

> Volunteers use ICTs for more timely data, and more inclusive voice and feedback from counterparts and communities.

Below are just a few of the ways that we see Volunteers using ICTs in these ways.

- **Diagnosis**—ICTs help bring new voices and broader participation into program diagnosis and enable a wider range of inputs at a reduced cost. They enable evaluators to better manage and pull possible trends out of large data sets.             
- **Planning**—ICTs can help achieve greater inclusion in planning processes. New technologies make it easier to compare and visualize data sets and to analyze data based on location so that resources can be better allocated. Data can also be aggregated more quickly and shared at various levels to improve participation in the planning process and support better decisions. New software tools can enhance the development and management of theories of change.
- **Implementation and monitoring**—ICTs allow for the collection of real-time data on participant experiences, behaviors and attitudes, meaning that analysis can be conducted early on in the process and course corrections can be made to improve interventions and outcomes. Direct feedback from program participants is also possible through new ICTs, which can allow for greater transparency and accountability.
- **Evaluation**—ICTs can increase the voice of vulnerable and underrepresented groups and broaden the types and volume of data that can be collected, combined, compared and analyzed. New technologies may be able to help overcome challenges and constraints such as sample bias and poor data quality, and they can improve the understanding of complex sets of behavior and data.
- **Reporting, sharing and learning**—ICTs enable wider circulation of evaluative learning, interactive sharing and greater public engagement with evaluation findings.

#### 4. Design Thinking

> Volunteers respond to the needs, preferences, and realities of their host communities and counterparts through cooperative problem-solving processes and iterative solution development—often called human-centered design, or more broadly as ‘design thinking.’

Design thinking is simply a way of approaching problem-solving in a way that puts the end-user first. Peace Corps Volunteers are trained to listen to their communities, to facilitate problem-solving, and to help act as agents of change within their service as Volunteers.

Starting with empathy as a first-principle is what has allowed the Peace Corps to consistently and effectively carry out our mission of ‘promoting world peace and friendship through community-based development, and grassroots understanding.’ It is the tuning fork of our mission, and the measuring rod against which we uphold our efforts.

Design thinking isn’t simply about crafting a design solution to a user-centered problem. It’s about ensuring that we are bringing all of the ideas, approaches, perspectives and priorities to bear on a recognized need or challenge. It’s about being a pupil to the problem and acting as a student would when learning a new language.

#### 5. Mapping and Geospatial Information

> Volunteers use geospatial information systems and mapping approaches to assist in community assessments, participatory analysis, and sector-specific projects.

The business case is predicated on the fact that the Peace Corps—through a wide variety of examples and previous efforts—has made significant investments in geospatial technology over the past ten years and that there is a need to protect and leverage those investments (both as a function of cost to the agency and use of staff time and resources). As an example, the plan identifies over 30 examples of GIS pilots and projects from just the previous five years at Peace Corps. With this volume of effort, a more coordinated approach to future investments, orchestrated by a dedicated GIO and GIO Office, should help to harvest synergies and avoid duplicative spending.

#### 6. Girls and STEM Education

> Volunteers empower youth and particularly girls and young women through an inclusive approach to digital literacy. These activities may occur through integration with formal education curricula, camps and clubs, workshops, conferences, trainings, and 1-on-1 mentorship and coaching.

#### 7. SMS and Mobile Communications

> Volunteers can use distributed messaging systems like SMS or short-texting services to amplify words of their projects, be more inclusive, and more timely. and programs.

SMS and mobile phones can improve productivity on farms, help farmers access markets and value chains, and improve the delivery of agriculture extension services. (areas related to where Peace Corps is -- Emergency response services, peacebuilding, governance, etc.)

Farmers are getting a revenue increases from market price SMS services. As other weather and extension services are added, and as this is supplemented by voice messaging, interactive voice response, and live operator call experts, this is going to be an even more effective tool. 

“We aim for a net gains in annual income for 3m farmers by services 2020.” - Mark Davies, CEO/Founder, Esoko

In Haiti’s “Cash for Work” program that paid displaced people cash in exchange for reconstruction work the use of mobile payments was rated to be safer by 82.5% of the participants.

#### 8. Radio and Mass Media

> Volunteers amplify the reach of their programs through broadcast technologies, leveraging their reach, affordability, and attention to local communities. teach English, personal hygiene, environmental lessons, and to promote civic dialogue.

Radio shows have been used to help volunteers share new musical genres with their host communities, This focus on sustainability allows community members to take over the radio station when the volunteer leaves. This helps to increase the long-term sustainability of these kinds of development projects. As well, the auditory nature of radio helps community residents, many who are illiterate, to gain important access to the information on the radio, without the necessity of reading.



___



#### 9. Libraries and Maker Spaces

> Volunteers have a long history of helping to renovate, build, and support local libraries in their communities. These are spaces foster inclusivity, learning and education, creativity, problem solving, and a place for community engagement.



___



#### 10. Climate Change Education

> Volunteers leverage ICTs as fundamental for monitoring climate change, mitigating and adapting to its effects and assisting in the transition towards green communities.



___



#### 11. mHealth (Mobile Health)

> Volunteers use mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones, computers, and digital services to facilitate access to health services and information.

Mobile health initiatives have been shown to strengthen the demand for health services, improve the ability of health workers to deliver those services, and strengthen health system capacity.

”Delivering vital health messages via mobile phones to new and expectant mothers enrolled in the MAMA Bangladesh program resulted in higher facility births (57%) among program participants compared to the national average (29%).

#### 12. Media Production

> Volunteers use geospatial information systems and mapping approaches to assist in community assessments, participatory analysis, and sector-specific projects.



___



#### 13. Youth Workforce Employment

> Volunteers use ICTs in extending training to more individuals at lower cost, providing a means to more broadly disseminate replicable and customizable content, providing opportunities for better learning outcomes, and enabling connections among youth and employers.

“In the developing world, it’s hard to find good information about jobs: resources are scarce and social connections are limited. Mobile job matching services mean that youth and employers can be linked anytime and anywhere - even in areas without internet.” - Jacob Korenblum, President and CEO, Souktel

#### 14. Appropriate Technology

> Volunteers employ methods that are recognized as encompassing technological choice and application that are generally small-scale, decentralized, labor-intensive, energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally controlled.

This entire Playbook is built with staff in mind.

Peace Corps staff should be able to quickly browse, search for, and find relevant information and tools to do their jobs -- whatever they may be.



## ICT4D as a CSPP

Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) fit into the agency framework of programming and training as a cross-sector programming priority. In other words, ICT4D supports the work of Volunteers through all sectors and at a global scale.

The agency defines CSPPs as, "On-going, cross sector areas of development in which the agency seeks to maximize quality, quantity, and impact of Volunteer activities."

The six (6) CSPPs currently are:

1. Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D)
2. Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment
3. Youth as Resources
4. HIV/AIDS
5. V2 Volunteerism
6. People with Disabilities

These CSPPs were [created by Executive Order](/img/initiatives-signed-memo-2012.pdf) from Peace Corps Director Carrie Hesslier-Radelet in 2012.

## Why ICT4D is a CSPP

At a fundamental level, ICT4D is an enabling lens -- it allows the work of our Volunteers and their counterpart communities to be more impactful and sustainable, to communicate more effectively, and to be all-around better Volunteers in their service.

The already-cross-cutting nature of ICT4D requires that it is understood as both broad and quite flexible, depending on the circumstances. Some posts might focus exclusively on geospatial information systems (GIS) as part of their project frameworks, while others focus on STEM and digital literacy for young girls' education. Both of these are considered ICT4D efforts, and do not need to necessarily overlap in significant ways.

It is difficult to find Volunteer projects in 2016 that do *not* leverage innovative approaches to how information, communication, technologies, data, and reporting play a role.

## Selecting ICT4D as a CSPP

Currently, posts "select" one to four CSPPs to focus on for their post. The selection of a particular CSPP is a signal to the post staff, to Headquarters staff, and to Volunteers that this is a priority area for that particular post. These selections can change from year to year, as well, dependent on post priorities and opportunities.

###### Should you select ICT4D as a CSPP?

I often am asked this question -- and I give a probably surprising answer. I haven't found the selection or non-selection of ICT4D as an 'official' CSPP to be a useful metric nor catalyzing action on the part of posts. 

As the program specialist for ICT4D, I respond to all requests for training, tailored support, Volunteer support, and consulting as equal requests.

Given that funding levels for CSPP-selection doesn't change (for ICT4D in particular -- I cannot speak for the others), nor my ability to support you and your Volunteers -- **this shouldn't be a priority.**

## Integration of ICT4D into Project Frameworks

How ICT4D as a CSPP is integrated is best determined by post and may differ by project at a given post. Examples include:

- Example 1: Integrate selected CSPPs into appropriate project frameworks or project plans
- Example 2: Integrate selected CSPPs through specific cross-sector activities, committees, and/or secondary activities.
 
## Training on ICT4D

Training around ICT4D, much like project framework integration, is going to differ from post to post and depend on program needs, Volunteer priorities, and managing ICT4D as a priority along with other training priorities.

That said, this entire Playbook is meant to provide a base level of training for Volunteers, and we are currently working on a more robust (1-hour overall training plus individualized modules) in a number of areas (focused around the [Toolkits](/toolkits/) and [Program Areas](/program-areas/)).
 
## Reporting on ICT4D

#### PSRs from Posts

Technically speaking, posts that select CSPPs are also required to report out in the Summary Post Reporting (PSR) process the extent to which the post has addressed the particular Peace Corps CSPP. While this is a helpful process globally, it is only helpful so long as it is immediately of-benefit to the posts. 

#### VRF/VRF

Volunteers have the opportunity to report on all CSPPs in the Volunteer Report Form (VRF). Volunteers are advised to consider these tips when filling out the VRF and their activities have an explicit or implicit ICT4D focus:
 
- Check the "**ICT4D**" box for activities where Volunteers leverage technologies (they are encouraged to be inclusive here—better to be counted even for broad use than not counted at all. No penalties.); and
- Use hashtags (**#**) to call out specific subjects, topical areas, technologies, and anything else that has a keyword value. This helps Peace Corps staff identify and sort the key words and phrases that Volunteers highlight. This isn't official policy, by the way -- it's just an incredibly helpful internal hack.

There are additional reporting tips for Volunteers (and also apply to staff!) around reporting by writing their experiences, case studies, and results in various forums, including [Peace Corps Passport](http://passport.peacecorps.gov) and [Medium's Peace Corps presence](https://medium.com/@PeaceCorps).

###### How do we learn about Volunteer activities around the world?


### Communities of Practice

There are many communications channels where activities related to ICT4D occur, including:

- **Social Media** such as the Peace Corps Technology Facebook group
- **Email Listservs** such as the regular ICT4D Email Newsletter
- **Staff** Points-of Contact for ICT4D projects and activities
- **Volunteer-led ICT4D committees** within Peace Corps countries
- The **National Peace Corps Association (NPCA)** and particularly the All Resources Connect team
- **Partners** comprised of RPCVs, government and non-governments organizations, and universities

### Programs, Reporting and Surveying

- **Volunteer Reporting Form (VRF)**—The VRF is the Peace Corps’ official reporting platform for Volunteers to document project activities and their related details. 
- **Post Summary Reports (PSRs)**—PSRs are staff summaries provided by posts around Volunteer activities and project frameworks.
- **Peace Corps Grants Online (PCGO)**—PCGO is the Small Project Assistance (SPA) and Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP) portal for grant submissions and donations. Many projects are tagged as ICT-focused.
- **Peace Corps Response (PCR)**—A number of PCR positions have an explicit ICT4D-related focus and these Volunteers are often the most focused and specialized in their efforts around ICT4D.
- **Peace Corps Master’s International (MI)**—Many of the Master’s International and Peace Corps Fellows programs have an ICT4D-related component or focus. Passport Blog Stories—There is a category for ‘innovation’ and ICT4D’ that contain articles written by staff, Volunteers, RPCVs, and partners.
- **Volunteer Blogs—Volunteer blogs provide some of the richest and most interesting updates around current uses of ICT4D**-related efforts.
- **Various Media Coverage**—Media outlets, newspapers, partners, bloggers, and researchers produce material that discusses Peace Corps, Volunteers, and ICT4D.

This is an ongoing and constantly-refreshed Q&A with post staff around the best ways that I can help support efforts around T4D for all posts. Please feel free to comment, edit, or ask new questions!



## ICT4D versus T4D?




## Is ICTD an Initiative, a Sector, a Cross-Sector Priority...or what?




## Who at headquarters can advise us on strategies our Volunteers might use to use computer technologies?

What we are really talking about are computers/systems that are ruggedized for typical environments where they will be placed. We met a few weeks ago with an organization, TechSoup (http://www.techsoup.org/), and they have agreed to provide both global support (like a one-pager to other resources) but also post-level support for helping Volunteers doing computer donation projects to solicit the right types of computers and help get them through customs and the like.

I have also set up a link to the Engineering for Change (http://engineeringforchange.org/) group which links us up to thousands of engineers who might be able to help with this more specifically. Hold tight on this, as we are still in the handshake process, but it holds a lot of promise.



## Can headquarters help us to procure equipment that would help Volunteers with media production, language manuals, publications and newsletters, etc.?

There are different ways that this might be able to work. I definitely understand the need to have a solid device for media, and I am personally using my own Macbook rather than the Peace Corps-supplied computer because of this need. 

If the challenge is the *policy* around supported Apple computers or A/V technology, then we might be able to help clear that up. If it's a matter of funds not being available at post, then that’s another story.



## How can a post stay informed of ways to be included in innovative pilots around technology -- such as Kindles and e-readers, tablets, smarthpone deployments, etc.?

The NPCA tablet project was for the moment a one-off pilot to see how tablets could be used in the hands of Volunteers. While I believe Peace Corps set up the initial relationship, it was ultimately done between Google and NPCA.

We are absolutely trying to map out the 'device to M&E'  challenge, and I'm working with the M&E folks in OPATS to look into a more robust and stable M&E data collection via mobile phone (through something like Open Data Kit, CommCare, or DataWinners). But we will definitely need pilot candidates, so this seems promising.



## Our Volunteers are using Dropbox and Google Drive to share resources with each other and their counterparts. Are these the best platforms for this type of use and is it sanctioned?

There is currently a Pilot project on Google Apps done by Peace Corps that is unfortunately winding down. Hopefully this means that the agency (via our OCIO) will move quickly to implement an agency-wide cloud-hosted productivity suite for email and document collaboration.

This will happen either with Google Apps or with Office 365. I wish this was moving faster than it is, and on my list of things it's currently the most important, but also the slowest-moving.



## We are thinking about what an ideal school library/computer -- what should we be thinking about?

Oh man -- this one might be a favorite of mine. I'm actually HUGELY into the idea of libraries and computer centers being much better thought out -- given that so many Volunteers pursue these types of projects.

I'm really interested in MakerSpaces and thinking about these spaces as collaborative learning and working spaces. On the side, I'm really into 3D printing...and I even have contacts at MakerBot who make one of the better 3D printers out there. Any change there would be a candidate community center that one of your Volunteers works at for this? Otherwise I'm trying to more generally assess how to advise these spaces and see what other Volunteers are up to.



## Digital File Storage. We’ve tried Google Drives, Facebook groups, Sharepoint, and our .org website as file storage locations. They all have their own limits: too much bandwidth, unfriendly user authentication process, bad (or no) search features, poor file management abilities. What do we do?

Ah yes. The perennial question. No great answers for this, I'm afraid. There is an initiative called "PC LIVE" which is official, and has been built over two years -- and is basically two systems smashed together (Joomla and SharePoint). I honestly feel that Peace Corps HQ is afraid to invest the resources in actually figuring out *what* Volunteers actual needs and preferences are.

I've been involved in this area for a little while and am ridiculously frustrated by the lack of coordination. I think it comes down to the fact that from your end -- it's not just about file storage, but it's also about the knowledge management stuff -- so like how to update it, how to keep your locally downloaded content up-to-date, etc. It's not a trivial problem, but it's also not rocket science. I'd love to explore more on this if you have thoughts.

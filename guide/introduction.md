> In the 21st century, I am convinced that Peace Corps is even better prepared and better positioned than virtually any other agency or institution to bring information technology to the task of poverty reduction.

Today’s Peace Corps Volunteers are helping people in developing countries take part in the digital and technological revolution that many in the western world take for granted. They are bridging the digital divide by teaching students and teachers to effectively use computers and the Internet for education, helping local entrepreneurs to create web sites to market their goods around the world, helping extend the reach of healthcare services, and training counterparts to use data for decision-making.

Information, data, technology, and digital services—these tools allow our dedicated Volunteer corps to share more, connect further, and to have a richer and more sustained impact for themselves and their communities.

###### Volunteer ICT4D-related activities at-a-glance for 2015

- Last year, nearly a third (1-in-3) Volunteers reported having used information and communication technology in their activities--that's just over 2,000 Volunteers (and our Specialist tells me that this is vastly under-reported).
- 9% of of Volunteers report on the AVS that their ‘ICT for Development’ is part of their work in Peace Corps.
- Nearly 11,500 ICT4D-related Activities reported on by Volunteers in FY2014.
- We have had more than 1,000 Volunteers serve as IT Volunteers in the CED sector.

Peace Corps Volunteers have long been on the cutting edge of finding ways for their communities and counterparts to leverage technology for as long as Peace Corps has been around—through the decades that span everything from ham radio and television to telecenters to computers labs now to mobile phones and open data.

Volunteers recognize that using information and communication technologies (ICTs) are an essential ingredient to making the most of their service. But it's important to remember that at the end of the day, Peace Corps has been (and will continue to be) about people. It's about promoting world peace and friendship through shared experiences and grassroots development.

This playbook explains the concepts of using ICTs for Development -- known as ICT4D -- for immediate use by Peace Corps Volunteers serving their communities. It covers the reasons *why* this is a critical area to understand, the principles underlying *how* to go about using ICTs in a way that is consistent with Peace Corps' mission, valus, and best practices, and also provides links to other communities, organizations, and resources.

## Audience

The Playbook has a wide and diverse audience:

- For currently-serving Peace Corps Volunteers from all sectors, regions, and countries.
- For Peace Corps Staff both at overseas posts and at PC/Washington.
- For Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCV) who wish to contribute and continue to learn from the Playbook.
- For the host-country community.
- For ICT4D practioners.
- For everyone who wants to make a difference in the world.

## Credits

I'd like to thank everyone that helped make this Playbook a reality. This wasn't the effort of a single person!

## Peace Corps ICT4D Playbook (this)

> The ICT4D Playbook guides Volunteers, staff, partners, and communities in carrying out ICT projects and activities most effectively.

The Playbook contains the overall strategy of ICT4D at Peace Corps, the Program Areas, the Principles, the Toolkits (resources and materials), and Communities. It is managed by Peace Corps ICT4D Program Specialist. I am currently working on developing offline, editable, searchable, and PDF/epub versions of this material.

For more, check out the [Playbook development](/playbook-development/).



## Peace Corps on-a-Stick

> The Peace Corps on-a-Stick provides Volunteers with a set of basic digital resources for use in the field. The USB 'stick' (flash drive or portable hard-drive) contains free and open-source software for Windows, Mac, and Linux-based computers.

A larger version of this database includes useful offline content useful as educational materials, teaching, and learning activities. Finally, the 'stick' contains relevant Peace Corps materials including a local version of the website, over 80 country cookbooks produced by Volunteers, and 4 gigabytes of language resources.

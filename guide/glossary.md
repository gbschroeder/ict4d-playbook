### API

Application Programming Interface. For data, this is usually a way provided by the data [publisher](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/publisher/)for programs or [apps](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/app-application/) to read data directly over the [web](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/web/). The app sends the API a [query](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/query/) asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving [bandwidth](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/bandwidth/) and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.

### Anonymization

Processing data that includes personal information so that individuals can no longer be identified in the resulting data. Anonymisation enables data to be published without breaching[data protection](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/data-protection-legislation/) principles. The principal techniques are aggregation and [de-identification](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/de-identification/). Care must be taken to avoid [data leakage](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/data-leakage/) that would result in individuals’ [privacy](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/privacy/) being compromised. UKAN studies best practice in data anonymisation. [source](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/)



### GIS

Geographical Information System, any computer system designed to read, display, analyse and manipulate geodata.



### GPS

The Global Positioning System, a satellite-based system which provides exact location information to any equipment with a suitable receiver (including modern smartphones). GPS is invaluable to many location-based apps, providing users with e.g. route-finding information or weather forecasts based on their current location. GPS is also a striking example of successful open data, as it is maintained by the US government and provided free of charge to anyone with a GPS receiver.



### Geodata

Any dataset where data points include a location, e.g. as latitude and longitude or another standard encoding. Maps, transport routes, environmental data, catastral data, and many other kinds of data can be published as geodata.



### Hackathon

An event, usually over one or two days, where developers, subject experts and others come together to create apps, visualisations and prototypes that aim to address problems in a particular domain, usually making heavy use of data. Hackathons focusing on a particular collection of data are a possible form of community engagement by data publishers. The hackathon is a popular format in the open source community.

- Our focus on technology was again reinforced as part of the FITU initiative in 2010, when we established ICT4D as a Cross-Sector Programming Priority. As with the other cross-sector programming priorities, I'm pleased to say that we have a dedicated, full-time staff member (Gabriel Krieshok) to focus exclusively on this important work.

- There are significant barriers to overcome as we as an agency try to remain on the forefront of technological innovation—sometimes it's a matter of keeping up with the Volunteers, sometimes it's a matter of keeping up with host country trends, opportunities, and needs, and sometimes it's a matter of adjusting our own approach towards technological innovation from the top-down at Peace Corps Headquarters.

- It's also a shift for Peace Corps staff. It's no secret that one of our challenges is that many of the "more seasoned Peace Corps staff" served in an era that in many ways looked very different from what we see now. No longer are the locales where Volunteers serve these "connectivity islands" where Volunteers are disconnected from the rest of the world for 27 months (although it might never have been this romanticized version!)

- Another challenge is that there's an assumption that Volunteers can naturally integrate technology into their work. But that's often not the case. This is not just about ‘getting out of the way’ from an Agency perspective. Saying that Volunteers are digital natives doesn't necessarily mean that they are trained in teaching and managing tech initiatives—just like knowing English doesn’t prepare you to teach English as a Foreign Language.

- We need to do a better job of supporting staff and coaching them on how Volunteers can fit ICTs into their work, and show them ways in which the technology can serve as an enabler rather than as a distraction. We also need to embrace that viewing projects and programs from a technology lens is not something that’s optional nor is it a moonshot project out of the Office of Innovation. On the contrary, integrating technology is a fundamental way for Volunteers and their host communities to have a greater and more effective impact. 

- Just like how we view things from a gender-empowerment lens, or the promotion of Volunteerism lens, or the leveraging of Youth as Resources—we need to see that information and communication technologies are part and parcel of achieving our mission. And there shouldn’t be a debate about that.

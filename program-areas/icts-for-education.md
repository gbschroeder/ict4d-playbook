# Introduction

Education is the largest sector of work for Peace Corps Volunteers, comprising nearly half of the entire Volunteer Corps.

Half of all ICT4D-related activities (approx. 1,717) were focused in schools (the other beneficiaries included Community Centers, Cooperatives / Associations, Government Offices, Health Centers, NGOs, and Private Businesses).

A focus on education through the lens of ICTs facilitates access to educational services, improves teacher capability to deliver those services, and strengthens education system capacity.

# Introduction

Welcome, cartography nerds! Our purpose here is to provide a basic overview and links to resources to get you started in GIS and mapping during your service as a Peace Corps Volunteer (and beyond).

It's important to remember that this field can be absolutely **HUGE** and sometimes overwhelming. Don't be discouraged! There are many points of entry, and even a little knowledge in this stuff can go a long way to making your projects more effective, transparent, and sustainable. So hopefully there's something for everyone here, and this toolkit can help you to level-up your mapping skills.

Without further ado, let's get started!

First, some definitions.

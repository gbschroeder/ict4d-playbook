# Introduction

Design thinking is simply a way of approaching problem-solving in a way that puts the end-user first. Peace Corps Volunteers are trained to listen to their communities, to facilitate problem-solving, and to help act as agents of change within their service as Volunteers.

Starting with empathy as a first-principle is what has allowed the Peace Corps to consistently and effectively carry out our mission of ‘promoting world peace and friendship through community-based development, and grassroots understanding.’ It is the tuning fork of our mission, and the measuring rod against which we uphold our efforts.

Design thinking isn’t simply about crafting a design solution to a user-centered problem. It’s about ensuring that we are bringing all of the ideas, approaches, perspectives and priorities to bear on a recognized need or challenge. It’s about being a pupil to the problem and acting as a student would when learning a new language.

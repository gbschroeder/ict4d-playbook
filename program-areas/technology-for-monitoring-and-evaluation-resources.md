# Readings

- [Does Technology Make Monitoring and Evaluation More or Less Efficient? - ICT Works](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/06/29/does-technology-make-monitoring-and-evaluation-more-or-less-efficient/)

> ICT has the potential to transform the efficiency and usefulness of data collection, as well as boosting organizational confidence in data collected through M&E systems. But it also has the potential to create inefficiencies if applied in inefficient operations where human capacity and technological infrastructure is low.

- [3 Systematic Reasons Why M&E Technology Projects Fail - ICT Works](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/06/26/why-me-technology-fails-too-complex-too-costly-too-siloed/) -- Complexity, cost, and interoperability.

- [Evaluating Tech Tools](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/02/11/3-phases-and-3-questions-in-evaluating-technology-tools-for-better-me/) -- Separate monitoring of ICT tools/platforms into three phases: rollout, implementation, and long-term use, adoption, and sustainability. Also answer three evaluative questions: What is the role of technology in organizational processes and is there ease of adoption among those using it, What is the role of tech in decision-making and program outcomes, and What level and type of tech support is provided or needed?

- [Case studies as a tool for sector learning](http://algoso.org/2014/12/16/case-studies-as-a-tool-for-sector-learning/) -- Exploring these questions -- How does a sector learn? What drives totally new practices, how do we verify and validate lessons from them, and which channels and mechanisms lead to their dissemination and iteration?

- [Four principles for Theories of Change in global development - Comment - Overseas Development Institute (ODI)](http://www.odi.org/comment/9882-four-principles-theories-change-global-development)

	1. Focus on process
	2. Prioritize learning
	3. Be locally led, and
	4. Think compass not map.

- [The 11 Things Everyone Should Know About Piloting a Survey - Knowledge Management for Development](http://www.km4dev.org/profiles/blogs/the-11-things-everyone-should-know-about-piloting-a-survey)

	1. Ensure that you have done enough secondary research
	2. Take feedback from your organization
	3. Choose a representative sample for piloting
	4. Pilot the survey in the correct medium
	5. Integrate the pilot with your training
	6. Question the survey questions
	7. Examine the data being collected
	8. Pilot all aspects of the survey
	9. Collect feedback from everyone
	10. Never re-pilot the same version of a survey
	11. Be thoughtful about what changes to make

- [E4C Webinars l Mobile Data Collection: A New Frontier of Tech4Dev Research - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BoPJP-3zFw) -- Webinar hosted by [Engineers for Change]() that explores: the challenges of data collection in field research; how data collection has been leveraged to collect more timely, accurate, and reliable data; and where the data collection field is headed.

- [7 Tips for Better Digital M&E in Sustainable Development - ICT Works](http://www.ictworks.org/2015/12/21/7-tips-for-better-digital-me-in-sustainable-development/)

	1. Involve Everybody
	2. Simple Technology
	3. Free to Use and Incentives
	4. Match Literacy and Languages
	5. KISS: Keep It Short and Simple
	6. Check Early For Bad Data
	7. Opt-in and Opt-out

- [Do ICTs Make Evaluation More Inclusive Or More Extractive? - ICT Works](http://www.ictworks.org/2016/01/04/do-icts-make-evaluation-more-inclusive-or-more-extractive/) -- Great and short thought-piece that explores the best aspects of M&E while also addressing a concern that they can do more harm than good when done poorly.

- [Community Mapping & Micro Planning Project For 264 Villages Across Vijayawada - SocialCops Blog](http://blog.socialcops.com/portfolio/community-mapping-micro-planning-project-264-villages-across-vijayawada) -- Great example of a case study formatted discussion from India.



# Certifications

- [Get Your Degree in M&E Tech with TechChange - ICT Works](https://www.techchange.org/online-courses/technology-for-monitoring-and-evaluation/?) -- This four week online certificate course will focus on building skills and strategies to better collect, manage, analyze and visualize data using a variety of tech tools.  It will feature live interactive guest expert presentations with leading M&E practitioners, software developers, and data scientists. It will also include a unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, immersive simulations and more.

- [CommCare Learning Tracks](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/CommCare+Learning+Tracks) -- For use with Dimagi's CommCare platform specifically (though the lessons can be generalized) -- "We have organized CommCare learning resources into modules on topics like Form Building and Mobile Worker Management. You can think of each of these as a "course." Once you complete a course you should be able to do most tasks associated with the module topic. Those modules are then organized into different tracks that build to more complex tasks. These tracks will guide you to acquire a specific skill-set."



# Organizations doing M&E

- [Evidence Gap Maps](http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/gap-maps/) -- Evidence gap maps (EGMs) consolidate what we know about what works in particular development sectors or thematic areas. 3ie’s EGMs identify evidence from systematic reviews and impact evaluations and provide a graphical display of areas with strong, weak or non-existent evidence on the effects of development programs and initiatives. It's very cool and useful, but only available for a limited number of topics relevant to Youth, CED, HE, and ED.

- [USAID’s Development Experience Clearinghouse](https://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/information-resources/development-experience-clearinghouse-dec) -- USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) is the largest online resource for USAID-funded technical and program documentation from more than 50 years of USAID's existence, with more than 155,000 documents available for viewing and electronic download. It's searchable: Use words or phrases, or perform a more advanced searches. You can also comment on documents, rate them, or vote on them to increase their usefulness to others.

- [USAID Program Evaluations](https://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/progress-data/evaluations) -- "USAID uses evaluation findings to inform decisions, improve program effectiveness, be accountable to stakeholders, and support organizational learning. Strengthening evaluation and transparency are part of the USAID Forward reform agenda."

- [USAID’s Development Data Library](https://www.usaid.gov/data) -- The Development Data Library (DDL) is USAID’s public repository of Agency-funded, machine readable data. The DDL is part of USAID’s commitment to evidence-based programming and rigorous evaluation, while supporting the principles of the President’s Open Government Initiative. This website provides raw data rather than the analysis or conclusions made from data.

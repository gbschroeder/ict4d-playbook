# Overview

For those new to ‘Design-Thinking’, there are some great video introductions -- including this [short video from the Grameen Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mcZKWhjr9o) that follows a process for identifying and scaling solutions to problems faced by poor people.

I highly recommend this TED talk from Timothy Prestero (RPCV Cameroon) entitled [Design for People not Awards](http://www.ted.com/talks/timothy_prestero_design_for_people_not_awards?language=en).

To follow up with, you should check out this slide-deck presentation of Design at Peace Corps, and this Medium post I wrote last fall entitled, [5 ways the Peace Corps embraces design thinking](https://medium.com/@PeaceCorps/5-ways-the-peace-corps-embraces-design-thinking-fecc23be0638#.6ai9pmrc8).

# Readings

- [Building Human-Centered Design Into ICT4D Projects](https://bestict4d.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/human-centered-design/) --  An Interview With Danny Alexander and Sean Hewens of IDEO:

	> “In the developing world so often where projects fail is the not around the actual technology or solution, but about how it is implemented in the context of the community.”

- [The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design - IDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4inpwsDx2GkS0Q2dnVmQUxHNm8/view) -- The amazing Field Guide from IDEO that lays out the big three in Design Thinking: Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation:

	> “Human-centered design offers problem solvers of any stripe a chance to design with communities, to deeply understand the people they’re looking to serve, to dream up scores of ideas, and to create innovative new solutions rooted in people’s actual needs.”

- [The Principles of Digital Development](http://ict4dprinciples.org/) -- Developed out of the GreenTree Consensus:

	> “These principles seek to serve as a set of living guidelines that are meant to inform, but not dictate, the design of technology-enabled development programs.”

- [Design Thinking is Making Headway in International Development](http://reboot.org/2013/12/06/design-thinking-is-making-headway-in-international-development-da/) - Dave Algoso of Reboot:

	>“...the human-centered elements of design provide a critical counterbalance to the donor-driven incentives that often result in terrible development practice.“

- [Why You Shouldn’t Call Yourself A Social Good Designer](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681328/why-you-shouldnt-call-yourself-a-social-good-designer) - Interview with Robert Fabricant in Fast Company:

	> “One of the most effective roles that a designer can play is by working across both public and private sector activities. Public sector organizations are hungry to learn from the private sector models these days. Similarly, our commercial clients are beginning to recognize the value of social sector work as a way to strengthen their market reach and invigorate their innovation capacity.”

- [Design Thinking for Social Innovation](http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/design_thinking_for_social_innovation) - Tim Brown and Jocelyn Wyatt:

	> “Design thinking incorporates constituent or consumer insights in depth and rapid prototyping, all aimed at getting beyond the assumptions that block effective solutions. Design thinking—inherently optimistic, constructive, and experiential—addresses the needs of the people who will consume a product or service and the infrastructure that enables it...Design thinking crosses the traditional boundaries between public, for-profit, and nonprofit sectors. By working closely with the clients and consumers, design thinking allows high-impact solutions to bubble up from below rather than being imposed from the top.”

- [8 Lessons for Creating Social Impact](http://www.fastcompany.com/1637282/8-lessons-creating-social-impact)  - Robert Fabricant for Fast Company:

	> “Unfortunately, designers tend to fall prey to ideas that are too attractive and we don't generally have the patience for the lengthy process to see initiatives through to the point of meaningful results (particularly if those results run counter to our attractive ideas).”

- [What Types of Problems Are Design Thinking Useful For?](http://developingjen.com/2013/04/29/what-types-of-problems-are-design-thinking-useful-for/) - Developing Jen:

	> “...I no longer think it’s a question of “Where human centered design is useful and where it’s not” but rather one of “How to draw on human centered design for the problem at hand.”  The hard part is building sophistication as a designer.”

- [Development, Data, and Ethical Design for our Wearable Futures](http://lindaraftree.com/2015/04/07/development-data-and-ethical-design-for-our-wearable-futures/) - Linda Raftree:

	> “No amount of creativity, however, replaces the realistic and sustainable value of developing technology that addresses real needs in local contexts. That’s where human-centered design and participatory processes play a vital role. Wearable products cannot be built in isolation without users, as various participants highlighted.”

- [Fundamentals of Design for Social Innovation](http://issuu.com/fitassociates/docs/sva_fundamentals_of_dsi_2013) - MFA 2014 Class in Design for Social Innovation at the School of Visual Arts in New York:

	> “The challenge is to think broadly enough to have a theory and a methodology that have the power to make a difference, and yet be simple and clear enough to be accessible to anyone who wants to make that difference.”

- [Tapping Into Human Centered Design to Create Financial Products People Need](http://blog.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/08/tapping-into-human-centered-design-to-create-financial-products-people-need) - Eileen Silva for the Kiva Blog:

	> “The need for well-thought out products has become apparent, and with this a drive in innovation. Organizations are increasingly realizing that there is a strong need for innovation for financial service providers (FSPs) to meet the needs of the poorest individuals. In order to improve on existing offerings, FSPs need to place their clients at the forefront of product design.”

- [The New Buzz at the Mobile World Congress](http://www.grameenfoundation.org/blog/new-buzz-mobile-world-congress#.VUjuVdpViko) - Camilla Nestor of the Grameen Foundation:

	> “Rather than assuming that more end-user education is needed, many usability challenges could be quickly solved by looking at the service through the lens of the end user, and designing around their needs and behaviors.”   

- [Design Thinking for the Poor (pdf)](http://www.piercegordon1.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Design-Thinking-For-the-Poor-A-Comparative-Content-Analysis-of-Development-Challenges-in-OpenIDEO.pdf) -- A Comparative Content Analysis of Development Challenges in OpenIDEO from Pierce Gordon:

	> “In the space of international development, experts aim to solve the problems of the poor with solutions driven by their expertise. Driven by technocratic problems, technologists driven to make the world a better place develop innovative technologies in widely disparate fields to serve the poor. Harnessing the process by which these technologies are made is impossible, however, by only considering the final product; one must consider the process by which the technology has been developed. “

- [Development by Design](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/707880/browse?value=Vasdev%2C+Samhir+Mohan&type=author) -- Leveraging Design Thinking for Improved Aid Effectiveness - Samhir Mohan Vasdev:

	> “How can design thinking help the World Bank and other aid institutions improve the effectiveness of development projects? This paper identifies six specific criticisms of World Bank projects and a toolkit of design thinking principles – a problem-centric focus, respect for local context, divergent and inclusive innovation, and iteration – that can be leveraged to address these criticisms and therefore improve aid effectiveness. “

- [Innovation for Developing Countries Through Human-Centered Design (pdf)](http://www.poverty.ch/documents/MasterSolarPumpKarin.pdf) -- The Example of  Micro Solar Pump in Bangladesh - Karin Imoberdorf

	> “In recent years, it has become more and more evident that traditional development strategies or charity alone will not solve these complex problems of inequity and unsustainability. Increasingly, the private sector is called upon to use its know-how, influence and innovations to sustainably serve those billions of poor people that have been neglected by global markets until this day.”

- [Adapting User Centered Design Methods to Design for Diverse Populations](http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/423/191) -- Cynthia Putnam, Emma Rose, Erica Johnson, and Beth Kolko:

	> “User-centered design (UCD) methods such as personas and scenarios are useful tools for communicating extensive user research to design teams. However, the intensive data collection and onsite required to create personas and scenarios can present barriers for user researchers and design teams working on technology innovations for diverse populations, including those in developing regions. This article presents a model that demonstrates how user researchers and design teams can use data collected for other purposes to source personas and scenarios and to substantively adopt user-centered design approaches. We demonstrate our methods based on research conducted in a case study in Kyrgyzstan, a country in Central Asia.”

- [A Different Role for Human-Centered Design within the Organization](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3_92O4iu-M3N2YwNDdBVi1XMVk) -- Sabine Junginger on Design Thinking in an organizational context:

	> “Human-centered design is in the process of assuming a new role in the organization for the organization: that of aiding organizations in organizing themselves around people.”

- [Asili Case Study - DesignKit - IDEO](http://www.designkit.org/case-studies/6) -- Good example of T4D approach with HCD. A sustainable community-owned health, agricultural, and water business in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

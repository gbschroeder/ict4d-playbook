This is an ongoing and constantly-refreshed Q&A with post staff around the best ways that I can help support efforts around T4D for all posts. Please feel free to comment, edit, or ask new questions!



## What is ICT4D?


ICT4D is 'Information and Communication Technologies for (4) Development'.

As a field of study, it combines various disciplines to offer a more holistic approach to *using technology for social good*. ICT4D is an academic field of research and education as well as a practitioners domain -- which is where we see it at the Peace Corps.

## What is the history of ICT4D at Peace Corps?

Peace Corps' forays into ICT as a target area came into being [in 2000 under Director Mark Schneider](http://www.peacecorps.gov/media/forpress/press/490/). The trend at the time globally and at Peace Corps was to think broadly at the level of computers in the classroom, telecenters, and the emerging phenomenon of cyber-cafes and connectivity.

After a brief lull in funding for support (the dark days from 2008-2014), ICT was supported on an ad-hoc basis -- and the Initiative was renamed Technology 4 Development (T4D) -- though it's unclear why this truncated acronym was chosen. The sector existed primarily as a Cross-Sector Programming Priority (CSPP) along with Volunteerism, Youth-as-Resources, HIV/AIDS, Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, and Working with People with Disabilities.

In late 2014, the ground swell of interest in ICT4D-related areas from Volunteers and posts was overwhelming (I'm looking at you, VRT and PSRs from staff), and the Office of Innovation pulled together to support ICT4D as an Initiative of Peace Corps at the highest level.

## ICT4D versus T4D?

'ICT4D' is the official term for the Peace Corps Initiative. 'T4D' was a placeholder for tech-related projects undertaken by Volunteers in between the ICT and ICT4D eras (roughly 2008 to 2014). ICT is still used as a general term for all Information and Communication Technologies (more of a noun, whereas the '4D' part gives it a vector towards social good.)



## Is ICT4D an Initiative, a Sector, a Cross-Sector Priority?

ICT4D is a sector that is housed in the Office of Innovation which is in turn part of the Director's Office of Peace Corps Washington. It is a global inititiave. It is *also* a CSPP (cross-sector programming priority) that is housed within Peace Corps' Office of Overseas Programming and Training Support (OPATS) which is housed in the Office of Global Operations (OGO) in Peace Corps Washington.

Don't let the org chart intimidate you. The power of ICT4D is that it is cross-cutting, it can be applied to all sectors, projects, and frameworks -- it's a lens that we use to look at our impact as Volunteers.



## Who at headquarters can advise us on strategies our Volunteers might use to use computer technologies?

Us! Well -- the staff here at PC/Washington ([ict4d@peacecorps.gov](mailto:ict4d@peacecorps.gov)) as well as the loose-knit and amazing ICT4D community of practice folks.

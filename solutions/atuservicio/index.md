###The Problem
In Uruguay, there are several health providers in which every citizen has to enrol to. As part of this, citizens are allowed to move insurance providers every year in the month of February. However, the data around health providers was not in good quality and was scatter in several dataset which did not allowed users to compare between service providers and to chose the one that fit them based on data. 

###The Solution
A web application which compare between the different providers based on government inspections and surveys. The data is sorted and allows the users to choose according to different criteria. 

###Uses
Citizens who are eligible to change their provider. 

###Data Used
Government data is available from the government portal here -

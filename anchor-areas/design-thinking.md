<p class="lead">Volunteers use design thinking and promote creative capacity-building to respond to the challenges of their host communities and counterparts.</p>

### Volunteer activities include:

- Using design thinking and creative capacticy building (CCB) to supplement PACA (Participatory Analysis for Community Actions)
- Investigate the needs, context, and assets of their environment and use cooperative problem-solving to build towards sustainable solutions.

# Overview


Design thinking is a way of approaching problem-solving in a way that puts people first. Peace Corps Volunteers are trained to listen to their communities, to facilitate problem-solving, and to help act as agents of change within their service.

Volunteers start (and end) their service from a foundation of empathy and cooperative understanding. It is this framing that has allowed the Peace Corps Volunteers to consistently and effectively carry out our mission of ‘promoting world peace and friendship through community-based development and grassroots understanding.’

Design thinking isn’t simply about crafting a design solution to a user-centered problem. It’s about ensuring that we are bringing all of the ideas, approaches, perspectives and priorities to bear on a recognized need or challenge.

For those new to ‘Design-Thinking’, there are some great video introductions -- including this [short video from the Grameen Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mcZKWhjr9o) that follows a process for identifying and scaling solutions to problems faced by poor people.

I highly recommend this TED talk from Timothy Prestero (RPCV Cameroon) entitled [Design for People not Awards](http://www.ted.com/talks/timothy_prestero_design_for_people_not_awards?language=en).

To follow up with, you should check out this slide-deck presentation of Design at Peace Corps, and this Medium post I wrote last fall entitled, [5 ways the Peace Corps embraces design thinking](https://medium.com/@PeaceCorps/5-ways-the-peace-corps-embraces-design-thinking-fecc23be0638#.6ai9pmrc8).



### Peace Corps Resources related to Design Thinking

A lot of the thinking around Design Thinking and UX comes from the existing corpus of Peace Corps work:

- [Role of the Volunteer in Development](http://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/T0005_rvidcomplete.pdf)
- [PACA Training Manual](http://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/PACA-2007.pdf) 
- [PACA Idea Book](http://files.peacecorps.gov/library/M0086.pdf) 
- [A Volunteer’s Guide to Community Entry](http://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/M0071.pdf) 
- [Non-Formal Education Manual](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/peacecorps/nonformal_ed_manual1.pdf) (can’t find Peace Corps link) 
- [Project Design and Management Manual](http://files.peacecorps.gov/library/T0107.pdf) 
- [Promoting Powerful People Manual](http://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/T0104_promotingpower.pdf) 



### Readings


- [Building Human-Centered Design Into ICT4D Projects](https://bestict4d.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/human-centered-design/) --  An Interview With Danny Alexander and Sean Hewens of IDEO:

	> “In the developing world so often where projects fail is the not around the actual technology or solution, but about how it is implemented in the context of the community.”

- [8 Lessons for Creating Social Impact](http://www.fastcompany.com/1637282/8-lessons-creating-social-impact)  - Robert Fabricant for Fast Company:

	> “Unfortunately, designers tend to fall prey to ideas that are too attractive and we don't generally have the patience for the lengthy process to see initiatives through to the point of meaningful results (particularly if those results run counter to our attractive ideas).”

- [What Types of Problems Are Design Thinking Useful For?](http://developingjen.com/2013/04/29/what-types-of-problems-are-design-thinking-useful-for/) - Developing Jen:

	> “...I no longer think it’s a question of “Where human centered design is useful and where it’s not” but rather one of “How to draw on human centered design for the problem at hand.”  The hard part is building sophistication as a designer.”

- [Fundamentals of Design for Social Innovation](http://issuu.com/fitassociates/docs/sva_fundamentals_of_dsi_2013) - MFA 2014 Class in Design for Social Innovation at the School of Visual Arts in New York:

	> “The challenge is to think broadly enough to have a theory and a methodology that have the power to make a difference, and yet be simple and clear enough to be accessible to anyone who wants to make that difference.”

- [The New Buzz at the Mobile World Congress](http://www.grameenfoundation.org/blog/new-buzz-mobile-world-congress#.VUjuVdpViko) - Camilla Nestor of the Grameen Foundation:

	> “Rather than assuming that more end-user education is needed, many usability challenges could be quickly solved by looking at the service through the lens of the end user, and designing around their needs and behaviors.”   

- [Design Thinking for the Poor (pdf)](http://www.piercegordon1.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Design-Thinking-For-the-Poor-A-Comparative-Content-Analysis-of-Development-Challenges-in-OpenIDEO.pdf) -- A Comparative Content Analysis of Development Challenges in OpenIDEO from Pierce Gordon:

	> “In the space of international development, experts aim to solve the problems of the poor with solutions driven by their expertise. Driven by technocratic problems, technologists driven to make the world a better place develop innovative technologies in widely disparate fields to serve the poor. Harnessing the process by which these technologies are made is impossible, however, by only considering the final product; one must consider the process by which the technology has been developed. “

- [Development by Design](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/707880/browse?value=Vasdev%2C+Samhir+Mohan&type=author) -- Leveraging Design Thinking for Improved Aid Effectiveness - Samhir Mohan Vasdev:

	> “How can design thinking help the World Bank and other aid institutions improve the effectiveness of development projects? This paper identifies six specific criticisms of World Bank projects and a toolkit of design thinking principles – a problem-centric focus, respect for local context, divergent and inclusive innovation, and iteration – that can be leveraged to address these criticisms and therefore improve aid effectiveness. “

- [Innovation for Developing Countries Through Human-Centered Design (pdf)](http://www.poverty.ch/documents/MasterSolarPumpKarin.pdf) -- The Example of  Micro Solar Pump in Bangladesh - Karin Imoberdorf

	> “In recent years, it has become more and more evident that traditional development strategies or charity alone will not solve these complex problems of inequity and unsustainability. Increasingly, the private sector is called upon to use its know-how, influence and innovations to sustainably serve those billions of poor people that have been neglected by global markets until this day.”

- [Adapting User Centered Design Methods to Design for Diverse Populations](http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewFile/423/191) -- Cynthia Putnam, Emma Rose, Erica Johnson, and Beth Kolko:

	> “User-centered design (UCD) methods such as personas and scenarios are useful tools for communicating extensive user research to design teams. However, the intensive data collection and onsite required to create personas and scenarios can present barriers for user researchers and design teams working on technology innovations for diverse populations, including those in developing regions. This article presents a model that demonstrates how user researchers and design teams can use data collected for other purposes to source personas and scenarios and to substantively adopt user-centered design approaches. We demonstrate our methods based on research conducted in a case study in Kyrgyzstan, a country in Central Asia.”

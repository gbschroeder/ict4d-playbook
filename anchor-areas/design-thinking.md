# Overview

Design thinking is a way of approaching problem-solving in a way that puts people first. Peace Corps Volunteers are trained to listen to their communities, to facilitate problem-solving, and to help act as agents of change within their service.

Volunteers start (and end) their service from a foundation of empathy and cooperative understanding. It is this framing that has allowed the Peace Corps Volunteers to consistently and effectively carry out our mission of ‘promoting world peace and friendship through community-based development and grassroots understanding.’

Design thinking isn’t simply about crafting a design solution to a user-centered problem. It’s about ensuring that we are bringing all of the ideas, approaches, perspectives and priorities to bear on a recognized need or challenge.

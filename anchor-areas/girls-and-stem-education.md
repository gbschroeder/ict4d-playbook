# Overview

Women in developing world cities are [50 per cent less likely](http://www.girleffect.org/what-girls-need/articles/2015/12/8-ways-2015-was-a-momentous-year-for-girls/) to access the internet than men. Education and income are determining factors. This doesn’t look good for girls, who are held back on both counts. 

We cannot afford to miss out on the talent and ingenuity of half the world’s population.

This is an area where there is a clear role for Volunteers—it aligns with a challenge that fuels their passion for service, it requires their skill sets of mentorship, coaching, and teaching, and it can be an incredibly fun way for Peace Corps to make a grassroots impact in these communities that is truly unique.

#### Volunteer report from Dominican Republic

> Using a borrowed LEGO Mindstorm kit, I have begun to train 5 young adults/adolescents on the use of robotics and the influence engineering and mathematics has on robotic programming. The intent of this initiative is to educate these 5 young adults on robotics and STEM based fields in order for each one of them to form their own groups of community teenagers and encourage them to pursue and enhance their mathematical ability through engaging activities with the LEGO Mindstorm kit.


#### Volunteer report from Zambia

> I taught about electricity at a local school using items that I had purchased in Chadiza to demonstrate electricity and how it works. Items included a speaker, a solar panel, batteries, a small motor, a radio, an electrical switch, and electrical wire. This was part of a bigger effort on my part to be more visible in the local schools and to encourage students to be engaged in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities.


#### Volunteer report from Morocco

> 'The Girls' Adventures in Math, Engineering and Science (GAMES) was an 8 day, overnight camp in Goulmima. The camp will provide girls with the opportunity to look at environmental and sustainability issues through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) lenses and leadership development activities. Sixty-five girls, ages 14 - 18, from around Morocco participated in hands-on activities and service learning projects in order to understand the interactions between humans and other living organisms outside of a classroom atmosphere and strengthen their civic engagement and management skills. Female participants were able to identify their personal skillsets, passions and how they can apply to STEM fields.

> The topics that were covered included; sustainability and how environment, culture, society and economy are linked; environmental pollutants and cycles they follow through the air, water, and soil; climate change; renewable energy sources and energy efficiency; water sources and clean water technologies and air quality management. Additionally, the camp was made possible with the collaboration of the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Youth and Sports, as well as several local associations.

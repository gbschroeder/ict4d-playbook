# Overview

Makerspaces are creative, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) spaces where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. In libraries they often have 3D printers, book printers, software, electronics, craft and hardware supplies and tools, and more. People are encouraged to create and consume as is the norm with the traditional library.

In so many of these communities that Peace Corps works in, women do not use tools -- but the transformation that occurs when we see someone enter the 'maker space' is such an amazing transformation.

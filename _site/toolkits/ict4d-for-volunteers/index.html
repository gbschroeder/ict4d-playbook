<p>I got your email from a fellow PCV, Holly Crance, who said you may be
able to help me with a project I’m working on for the Gender Committee
in Botswana. As the Gender Committee, we have compiled hundreds of
gender resources available to PVCs over the years including project
ideas, funding opportunities, and community mobilization tools.
Unfortunately, these wonderful resources are so overwhelming in number
that they are hardly used. So, I offered up the idea of creating a
survey for volunteers to complete online in order to narrow down the
amount of resources they have to read through. I had envisioned a 10
question survey that would sift through our GoogleDoc page that
currently holds all our resources and rank the top 5 or so for that
volunteer. We, as a committee, can create and sort each resource based
on pre-set parameters but do not have anyone in-country who can create
the actual survey application. I was hoping that you, or someone in
your office, would be willing to either point us in the right
direction of someone who has previously done a similar project or else
help us to create this application. Any help would be highly
appreciated!</p>

<p>Anna (and Parker and Chawapiwa!) — </p>

<p>Great to meet you! And Excellent question. Let’s break it down and see if I can’t help…</p>

<p>As I understand it, you’ve already got all of the material collected, but you’re just trying to crowdsource the relative worth and ranking of them? I really like this idea. In fact, it’s probably a model that could end up being really useful for a LOT of Peace Corps content!</p>

<p>The most straightforward solution would be to create like a form even just in Google Docs that would have folks identify their top resources (by literally writing them out or something akin to that). That would be a lot of typing by individuals and probably not be very fun.</p>

<p>Instead, the approach I’d probably start with would be to literally copy/paste the names of all the files in your drive (I use an application like Print Window on a Mac [<a href="http://www.searchwaresolutions.com/">http://www.searchwaresolutions.com/</a>] to accomplish this automatically), put them in a long Excel spreadsheet, and then have individuals write their names in a new column (one per person), and then they can give X points out to their favorites (say everyone gets 5,4,3,2,1, etc.) The analysis would be really straightforward and you would just sum the end of the of the row. Does that make sense? I could mock up a template in two seconds if it doesn’t. It sounds harder than it is.</p>

<p>Another way would be to use Reddit-like functionality and have users “vote” in a public fashion. You’d have to do some setup, but an app like <a href="https://www.myvote.io/demo">https://www.myvote.io/</a> would work, though they are all freemium at this stage so might cost money if you want more than say 50 votes — so not sure I’d see anything you could easily mold to fit your purposes, and the setup might be too much work.</p>

<p>Finally, you could just ‘crowdsource’ it on the fly by setting up folders in the Google Drive. Dump everything into “Unsorted”, then make whatever categories you want, either ranking from 0-10 or using qualifiers like, “Excellent”, “Interesting”, “Trash”, etc…this can sort of work, until people actually had legitimate disagreements about the relative worth of a document (I’ve done this on a team where it was obvious what was good and what wasn’t…so it works in that scenario).</p>

<p>Am I getting closer to helping?</p>

<p>Let me know — this is actually a process we should go through with a lot of our material as well…</p>

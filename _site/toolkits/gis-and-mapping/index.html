<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome, cartography nerds! Our purpose here is to provide a basic overview and links to resources to get you started in GIS and mapping during your service as a Peace Corps Volunteer (and beyond).</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that this field can be absolutely <strong>HUGE</strong> and sometimes overwhelming. Don’t be discouraged! There are many points of entry, and even a little knowledge in this stuff can go a long way to making your projects more effective, transparent, and sustainable. So hopefully there’s something for everyone here, and this toolkit can help you to level-up your mapping skills.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s get started!</p>

<p>First, some definitions.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-gis">What is GIS?</h5>

<p>Up first—A GIS (Geospatial [or Geographic] Information System) system is ‘designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">wikipedia source</a>).</p>

<p>When we talk about GIS, we could be referring to the academic discipline, the collection of software and platforms, processes, or even simply data that has a spatial component. Context matters here in determining which one is being discussed. Also, you’ll sometimes see ‘GIS’ and ‘Mapping’ thrown around interchangeably. For our purposes in this toolkit, they are interchangeable, so try not to get hung up on them.</p>

<h5 id="what-are-maps">What are maps?</h5>

<p>Second—Maps. What are maps? OK, that’s actually going to be a tough one, and it’s a little outside of the scope here to define. Suffice it to say, this toolkit is basically going to refer to <a href="http://americangeo.org/map-links/">awesome maps like this</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/5032/products/World_Maps_International_20mil_1.jpg?v=1413619116" alt="World Map" />
<em>Don’t be tempted by the neo-colonial legacy hegemony of the oft-used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a>. This is Peace Corps.</em></p>

<p>But when we talk about GIS, we’re not simply talking about political maps that have different colors for different countries that are neatly labeled and agreed upon.</p>

<p>We could be talking about specific parts of the world zoomed in from countries, even down to specific neighborhoods and addresses. It’s not just labels of place names, but can be things like shapes of rivers, lakes, and mountains (topography), boundaries of areas that might include data on land ownership or voting districts (sometimes called polygons or shapes), and points of interest or dots where interesting things occur (points), as well as images overlaid on top of these maps that might show temperatures of hot spots or satellite imagery.</p>

<p>Phew.</p>

<p>Oh, and it’s not just in two-dimensions (could be three or even four!), and it might not be static like a map on a wall, but dynamic like a map that lets you zoom in and out and select different layers of interest. Oh, now that I’ve mentionned ‘layers’…</p>

<h5 id="show-me-the-layers">Show me the Layers</h5>

<p>Before your mind explodes, just try to digest this image. The amazing thing about maps, mapping, GIS, and computers these days is that we can put all of these things together in new and interesting ways.</p>

<p>We can see relationships and data presented to us in a way that allows us to see new connections, gain new insights, and monitor important situations.</p>

<p>This great image below shows how these pieces <em>can</em> fit together to combine data into something that could be really interesting (<a href="http://www.co.ontario.ny.us/index.aspx?NID=1176">image source</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.co.ontario.ny.us/images/pages/N1176/gisdata.jpg" alt="GIS Data Layers" /></p>

<h5 id="how-to-think-about-gis-for-volunteer-projects">How to think about GIS for Volunteer projects</h5>

<p>Now that your mind has hopefully been blown a little bit, let’s roll up our sleeves. How in the heck can you use maps in your projects? The most important piece of advice that I can give would be to think of GIS and mapping as <strong>the thing that allows you to do the thing</strong>, they aren’t the thing itself….</p>

<p>…huh?</p>

<h5 id="do-gis-projects-by-not-starting-with-gis-tools">Do GIS projects by not starting with GIS tools</h5>

<p>Basically this just means that you should think of GIS and mapping as tools to achieve your objectives as a Peace Corps Volunteer first, not simply as the solution that’s going to magically solve things for you. One helpful exercise before even beginning to sort through the links and resources below is to define what you’re wanting to do <em>without</em> invoking technology or mapping. Why do this? One, because it helps to ensure you’ve got a clearly articulated objective laid out ahead of you. Two, it’s actually kind of difficult.</p>

<p>An example of this – maybe you want to “create a map of all the bednets that are distributed within my community.” Great! But let’s think about this – why do we want to create a map of this? What are we missing?</p>

<p>“…so that we can see where there are unequal distributions of the nets and correct for that on an ongoing basis…” Better, but not perfect. Maps don’t do that magically – we need to think about the data behind the map, and connect that to the lessons learned from that, and connect these two with our mapping platform as the vehicle to move us from point A to point B.</p>

<p>“Our team would like to correct for unequal distributions of bednets across our community in as real-time as possible.” Ahhh. Doesn’t that feel better? We know what we want, and we know what success is. NOW, we just get to add the tool that we’ll use to achieve that – “…by using an easily accessible and editable web-map…”</p>

<h5 id="moving-forward-with-confidence">Moving forward with confidence</h5>

<p>This is a great start. But it also should just be the beginning. As with any project like this, you’ll also want to consider things like designing with your users in mind, using open-standards, addressing privacy and security of the data, and how you’re going to make this project sustainable and not simply a one-off that looks oh so cool on your DOS (Description Of Service). Lots more on this here and in other toolkits.</p>

<p>But enough talk – let’s check out some of these resources! Remember that they are works in progress, and new stuff is coming down the pike every single day. Help to contribute to this toolkit (or any of the ICT4D Playbook Toolkits) by checking out the Contributing page. We need your help!</p>

The suite of ESRI tools is pretty expansive, ranging from consumer-level items like their smartphone apps all the way up to enterprise-level server platforms. If you’re getting involved in GIS, you’ve no doubt heard this name, especially with respect to ArcGIS Desktop. Last update it was still PC-only. But if you’re looking for the closest open-source equivalent to ArcGIS Desktop, I would recommend QGIS.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> – Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. Basically compares to ArcGIS Desktop (with even a few bells and whistles added). It’s a little <em>less</em> user friendly, and it’s more-or-less a standalone GIS solution (it won’t host the content or provide you raw datasets). Check out the tutorials to level up on this if you’re ready to move past looking at OpenStreetMap layers. Also has Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available.</p>

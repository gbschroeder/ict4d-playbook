    <blockquote>
  <p>As Volunteers listen and learn from their communities, they become facilitators, assistants, mentors, and even leaders. They strive to adapt their skills, experiences, and insights to meaningful efforts defined and shaped by the communities themselves. ICTs comprise the tools and technologies that help them serve their communities with the greatest impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a perfect world, ICTs should be the unsung hero—the invisible catalyst—of social and economic development. They should recede into the background of any intervention, allowing for the people, the change, and the solution to emerge as the essential ingredients to the social good endeavor.</p>

<p>ICTs have an integral part to play as tools in preparing the ingredients of social and economic development.</p>

<h3 id="five-reasons-to-use-icts-in-peace-corps">Five reasons to use ICTs in Peace Corps</h3>

<h5 id="improve-the-quality-of-the-services-volunteers-provide">1. Improve the quality of the services Volunteers provide.</h5>

<p>At the end of the day, Volunteers have committed themselves to serve for two years – and they are in their communities to work. In that effort, they make use of the tools, technologies, resources, and assets around them to provide a value-add to their presence in their community, and to do so at the highest quality available and to have the greatest impact.</p>

<h5 id="improve-their-ability-to-serve-more-people">2. Improve their ability to serve more people.</h5>

<p>A megaphone allows someone to speak with a louder voice. ICTs can help whole communities speak with a louder voice, and to have a wider reach and broader impact. It can also how Volunteer activities to reach new groups of beneficiaries and underserved populations.</p>

<h5 id="help-people-to-use-information-to-manage-better">4. Help people to use information to manage better.</h5>

<p>Access to tools and technologies is not enough by itself—ICTs can also help to improve the management of projects in and of themselves: everything from project design, monitoring &amp; evaluation, assessment, and learning. ICTs increase efficiency so as to conserve resources.</p>

<h5 id="leverage-experience-from-one-project-sector-and-volunteer-to-the-next-more-effectively">5. Leverage experience from one project, sector, and Volunteer to the next more effectively.</h5>

<p>Volunteers are more effective when they learn from each other, from their predecessors, and when they are teachers to the next group of Volunteers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-vision-for-ict4d-at-peace-corps-is-to-mainstream-the-use-of-ict4d-solutions-to-enable-volunteers-to-be-more-effective">The vision for ICT4D at Peace Corps is to mainstream the use of ICT4D solutions to enable Volunteers to be more effective.</h2>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-three-ways-in-which-volunteers-use-ict4d">The three ways in which Volunteers use ICT4D</h3>

<h6 id="empower-individuals-in-narrowing-the-digital-divide">1. Empower individuals in narrowing the digital divide.</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provide resources, guidance and institutional infrastructure to support Volunteer efforts in promoting and teaching digital literacy and transferring technology skills to counterparts, and communities, and host countries in general, and specifically towards disadvantaged populations with respect to ICT awareness and opportunities including youth, women and girls, and rural populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h6 id="amplify-volunteer-efforts">2. Amplify Volunteer efforts.</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>Support information and communication technologies as an enabling tool for Volunteer efforts. Amplify the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of Volunteer programs and projects. ICT serves as a means to achieve particular ends and therefore plays a role in all activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<h6 id="support-volunteers-use-of-information-and-communication-technologies-icts">3. Support Volunteers’ use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>Foster communities of information and resource exchange through technological channels and opportunities. Manage communities of practice and interest in T4D areas for Peace Corps Volunteers, staff, counterparts, strategic partners, and the general public through the blended use of digital and traditional tools of communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebox-the-peace-corps-niche">Sidebox: The Peace Corps Niche</h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peace Corps Volunteers are able to have the most impact when they operate at the intersection of national priorities and resources, community priorities and assets, and the Volunteers’ own knowledge, skills, and attitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recognizing that particular roles and projects are going to be more easily accessible and achievable by Volunteers is key to the Peace Corps having the as much an impact as possible.</p>

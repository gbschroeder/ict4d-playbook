<div class="post">
  <article class="post-content">
    <a href="/guide/" class="pre-header">guide</a>
    <h1 class="post-title">Principles</h1>
    

    <p>In earlier versions of this playbook, the ‘plays’ (now principles) were amassed from the <a href="http://digitalprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Greentree_Principles_2010.pdf">Greentree Consensus</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">UK Design Principles</a>, the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, current practices in the field of ICT4D, and Peace Corps practices (PACA, Role of the Volunteer in Development, Core Expectations, etc.)</p>

<p>With the creation of the <a href="http://digitalprinciples.org/">Digital Principles</a> in 2015, we have opted to adapt their excellent framework and then to provide descriptions more relevant to Peace Corps Volunteers below the principle.</p>

<h4 id="design-with-the-user">1. Design with the user</h4>

<p>As Peace Corps Volunteers, you must design and build <em>with</em> your communities and counterparts as opposed to <em>for</em> them. It’s not enough to simply start a project, program, club, or activity simply for the sake of doing something. Rather, a Volunteer should adopt the needs and priorities of the community and contribute to help <em>them</em> meet <em>their</em> goals.</p>

<h4 id="understand-the-existing-ecosystem">2. Understand the existing ecosystem</h4>

<p>G.K. Chesterton said “Don’t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up,” Volunteers should think of themselves as anthropologists and ethnographers when beginning to think about their service–as keen observers of people, relationships, systems, and possibilities. This applies as equally to website development as it does to starting an English club.</p>

<h4 id="design-for-scale">3. Design for scale</h4>

<p>Volunteers do incredible work at the grassroots level – working individually with members of their community and neighborhood. To have a truly resounding impact, Volunteers think about their projects as a system, and how they might translate their efforts across activities, to other sectors, and even around the world.</p>

<h4 id="build-for-sustainability">4. Build for sustainability</h4>

<p>Thinking sustainably is critical for your service as a Volunteer to have long-term impact. It’s not simply about the project, the activity, or the technical platform, but can be as simple as who is going to support and maintain activities after the Volunteer departs.</p>

<h4 id="be-data-driven">5. Be data driven</h4>

<p>Being data driven isn’t simply about measuring what’s easily reported (number of children attending a camp, or number of bednets distributed), but is much broader and refers to both quantitative and qualitative approaches of collecting feedback, adjusting to lessons learned and new insights, and managing projects and activities effectively.</p>

<h4 id="use-open-standards-open-data-open-source-and-open-innovation">6. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation</h4>

<p>Peace Corps Volunteer projects have so much to gain by leveraging the opportunities provided by open data, open source software and applications, and open standards of materials, resources, and tools. Volunteers should be wary of investing time (and certainly money) on behalf of their activities into proprietary systems and standards which might jeopardize project costs, sustainability, and/or usability. This applies equally to what you may use as to what a Volunteer may help to build.</p>

<h4 id="reuse-and-improve">7. Reuse and improve</h4>

<p>Volunteers help their communities to start where they are, use what they have, and do what they can—starting the day they arrive. You are used to thinking creatively and adapting to activities and approaches to what resources are already available.</p>

<h4 id="address-privacy--security">8. Address privacy &amp; security</h4>

<p>Volunteers need to be clear with their communities when they collect data or engage in digital activities about how any information is collected, stored, analyzed, shared, and used. Data can have very real and negative consequences both for the population of folks the data is about, and also the organization charged with securing and transmitting that data. This includes everything from personally identifiable information to systems of trust in a text-messaging app.</p>

<h4 id="be-collaborative">9. Be collaborative</h4>

<p>“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” is a proverb that is often used in Peace Corps manuals and applies equally to ICT4D projects. Being a Volunteer may feel very solitary at times, but always remember that help is not far away, that many of us are in this together, and that “all of us are smarter than any of us.”</p>

# Software



<div class="note"><h6>Portable Apps</h6>
<p>A portable app is a “lite” version of a software, which can be run without being installed on the host computer, and which doesn’t modify the computer’s configuration information. In other words, you can run it, and use it, and you won't disturb the computer or settings.</p>
</div>


## Antivirus and Malware

Computer viruses are a problem throughout the world -- and are compounded in many Peace Corps countries where limited and expensive connectivity means that anti-virus software, definitions, and malware protection are often not up-to-date with the latest protections. You'll encounter many computers and USB drives with viruses that have been "identified and destroyed" years ago for most U.S.-based computer users.

- [ClamWin](http://www.clamwin.com/) -- Free, standalone antivirus program for Windows with high detection rates for viruses and spyware. The virus databases are updated on a regular basis. [Portable Windows version](http://portableapps.com/apps/security/clamwin_portable)

- [SUPERAntiSpyware](http://www.superantispyware.com) -- Quick, complete, and custom scanning for spyware of many parts of your computer including hard drives, removable drives, memory, and the registry. A portable version is useful, even for your own computer, because many of the worst malware infections block you from installing malware removal software or block it from running if you manage to get it installed. The SUPERAntiSpyware portable scanner is saved under a random filename so that malware infections won’t block the scanner. [Portable Windows version](http://www.superantispyware.com/portablescanner.html).

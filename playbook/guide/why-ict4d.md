Greater access to information and increased communications in a society are associated with positive outcomes for that society.[^1]

In the past two decades alone, advances in mobile technology and digital connectivity have completely revolutionized how we interact with the world around us. They also provide unparalleled opportunities to deliver social impact and economic returns to millions of people in developing countries, while engaging new actors in the development process.

Peace Corps' mission, we recall, is to promote world peace and friendship through the efforts of our Volunteers who dedicate themselves to serve in international communities that request it.

There is much to be gained by grounding ourselves in the Peace Corps foundation of service, empathy, and sustainaibility, all the while looking through a lens of data, information, and technology. The two domains have much to learn from one another, and even more to offer.

What we see in the ICT4D landscape within Peace Corps is that while the tools may change over time, what remains constant is the central drive of all Peace Corps Volunteers—to start where they are, with what they have, to do what they can to make a better, more inclusive, more connected world.



## What Volunteers do

Volunteers serve as development workers who are immersed for 27 months in their host country of service (often the low and lower-middle-income countries)[^1], working in one of six sectors ([Education](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/edu_youth/), [Health](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/health/), [Youth Development](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/youth/), [Community Economic Development](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/busdev_01/), [Agriculture](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/agr/), and the [Environment](http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/learn/whatvol/env/)).

These placements are most often in remote cities, town, and villages while the work of the Volunteer has them interacting with community members far and wide. Volunteers engage in projects and programs that increasingly make use of mobile devices either for their own sake (as educators and generalists mastering new skills), or as a means to increase the effectiveness of their existing projects and programs (as agriculturalists, environmentalists, etc.).

In addition to the six sectors that Volunteers work in for the primary projects, Peace Corps has also identified six topics of work that cut across all sectors and activities–Gender Equality & Women’s Empowerment, People with Disabilities, HIV/AIDS, Youth as Resources, Volunteerism, and Information and CommunicationTechnologies for Development (ICT4D).[^2]



## Who Volunteers support

Progress and opportunity is not evenly distributed.

But empowerment and progress are not a certainty. Access to technologies, to information, and to services can also serve to exacerbate and amplify inequality, limit opportunities to the rich and well-connected, and leapfrog marginalized communities.

The reality is that our economic, social and political life in the 21st century will be increasingly digital, and **those without information and communication technologies (ICTs) will be increasingly marginalized, excluded, and exploited.**



## Volunteers are serving in the digital age

Communities where Volunteers serve are no longer the isolated, connectivity oasis’ they once were. They have access to information and digital services never before within their reach and they have new opportunities to influence the world around them. Volunteers can now communicate electronically not just with their counterparts, communities, and Peace Corps staff within the country, but also with friends, family, and experts across the globe—at any hour, night or day.

The world is now more interconnected, informed, and able to access, find, and create information than at any time in human history. This global connectivity illustrates that opportunities for Peace Corps Volunteers to more effectively carry out the mission of world peace, cross-cultural understanding, and grassroots development are both evident and vital.

There are four reasons underlying Peace Corps’ investment in ICT opportunities at the local and global scale:

#### 1. The tech landscape

The tech environment (particularly connectivity and Internet access) of host country environments has changed dramatically during the last decade, which has brought mobile phones and connectivity to all but the most remote of environments where Volunteers serve.

#### 2. Volunteer expectations

Volunteers find it routine to pack their mobile devices (phones, laptop computers, tablets, etc.) from home service. They are  comfortable using communication tools and technologies for their professional work.

#### 3. Host-country demand

Host country projects, local counterparts, and host communities have established a high demand for ICT-related projects and skill sets for achieving their development outcomes.

#### 4. Cultural and social integration

A weaving of the previous three points leads to a landscape of Volunteers, counterparts, and communities where the existence and use of technology for both personal and professional purposes is less taboo and is the status quo if not an outright requirement.

## Peace Corps is not the exception

The 'why ICT4D' does not apply exclusively to Peace Corps or to the Volunteers. Countless organizations and entrepreneurs are seizing the opportunities presented by leveraging ICTs -- everyone from large multi-lateral donor agencies  to the grassroots community organizers.

[^1]: 'Low and lower-middle-income' as a designation for countries where Peace Corps serves isn't ideal. For a really interesting exploration of terms like these and 'the global south' and 'the third world', check out [this story from NPR's Goat and Soda](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/04/372684438/if-you-shouldnt-call-it-the-third-world-what-should-you-call-it) blog.

[^2]: Why is this 'ICT4D' and not simply 'T4D'? The short answer is that the the 'IC' is more inclusive, is the official name, and is what the [academic and practioner field refers to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development).

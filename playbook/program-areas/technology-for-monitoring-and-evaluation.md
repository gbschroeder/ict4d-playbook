<p class="lead">Volunteers use mobile technologies to monitor their project activities, collect feedback, evaluate their work, and scale their successes. They train their communities on data-driven decision-making, analysis, and reporting.</p>

Volunteer activities include:

- Using mobile phones to capture survey data while in the field.
- Training local staff and counterparts on mobile data collection.
- Promoting best practices in mobile dataâ€”including privacy and security awareness and data responsibility.

# Overview

Mobile data collection allows Peace Corps Volunteers to adopt a real-time, feedback-oriented, documented approach to their projects and activities. It enables our service to be oriented towards impact, and for our Volunteers to become better development professionals. These are just a few of the ways that we see Volunteers using ICTs in these ways:

- **Diagnosis**. ICTs help bring new voices and broader participation into program diagnosis and enable a wider range of inputs at a reduced cost. They enable evaluators to better manage and pull possible trends out of large data sets.  

- **Planning**. ICTs can help achieve greater inclusion in planning processes. New technologies make it easier to compare and visualize data sets and to analyze data based on location so that resources can be better allocated. Data can also be aggregated more quickly and shared at various levels to improve participation in the planning process and support better decisions. New software tools can enhance the development and management of theories of change.

- **Implementation and monitoring**. ICTs allow for the collection of real-time data on participant experiences, behaviors and attitudes, meaning that analysis can be conducted early on in the process and course corrections can be made to improve interventions and outcomes. Direct feedback from program participants is also possible through new ICTs, which can allow for greater transparency and accountability.

- **Evaluation**. ICTs can increase the voice of vulnerable and underrepresented groups and broaden the types and volume of data that can be collected, combined, compared and analyzed. New technologies may be able to help overcome challenges and constraints such as sample bias and poor data quality, and they can improve the understanding of complex sets of behavior and data.

- **Reporting, sharing and learning**. ICTs enable wider circulation of evaluative learning, interactive sharing and greater public engagement with evaluation findings.

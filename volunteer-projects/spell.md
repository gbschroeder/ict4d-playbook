The SPELL team has been working to bring technologies that might help to improve the quality of education there. They started working with some Peace Corps volunteers few years ago, and came to see some of the challenges they had, as educators, working in the schools where they're stationed. This library was designed with their specific challenges in mind: teaching English, and using technology within the schools, while also providing additional content that they may not have access to otherwise. Check out their [content website](http://pacificschoolserver.org/), and of course, keep up to date with their [blog](http://solarspell.org/).

After receiving a seed grant from the Pacific Telecommunications Council, they've been able to develop the libraries and build 50+ of them, with assistance from students at my university, Cal Poly. They proposed providing the libraries to PCVs in both Micronesia and Vanuatu, and both countries have agreed and have invited us to carry out trainings with the volunteers on how to use the libraries.

In 2013, A group of Peace Corps Volunteers in Zambia worked with local software developers to create [Bantu Babel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bongohive.rhok.apps.bantubabel), a mobile app on the Android platform that acts as both a dictionary for seven less commonly-spoken Bantu languages in Zambia while also providing a basic phrasebook for those languages ([video background of the project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auaaI3h5fms)).

This project sparked into being from a recent [Innovation Challenge Hackathon](http://innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov/) sponsored by Peace Corps Headquarters in Washington, calling on Volunteers, coders, and development workers all around the world to take a look at solving challenging problems through innovation and technology.

- [Yes, Your Cellphone Speaks Dialect! (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryl9-p0di7o) -- From InfoDev at the World Bank:

	> Lost in Africa? No problem, your cellphone speaks African dialect. You just need to download an app called Bantu Babel to get you to the next hotel or restaurant. Two young developers have invented this mobile app for seven Zambian dialects. It is already being used by the U.S, Peace Corps. Other African languages will follow.

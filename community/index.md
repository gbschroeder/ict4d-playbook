## Peace Corps ICT4D Community

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Playbook](http://playbook.peacecorpsict4d.org) -- hosts the Playbook, Guide, Program Areas, Toolkits, and Volunteer Projects

- [Peace Corps Community on Slack](http://www.peacecorpscommunity.slack.com) -- RPCV-run Slack team that is open to all, with #ict4d channel -- get an [Invitation](http://slack.peacecorpsict4d.org)!

- [Peace Corps Technology Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ict4pcv/) -- Strong membership with good involvement, this is the place to post updates to PCVs, RPCVs, etc. Managed by the ICT4D Initiative folks for now.

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Hub](http://hub.peacecorpsict4d.org) -- Pilot program of a reddit-like forum (voting, commenting, etc.) for Peace Corps' ICT4D efforts. Open to the public.

- [Peace Corps ICT4D Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3_92O4iu-M3fkdpTXpKdzQ2Q2dJQWdkRElGX1dfMzlmMThPTDRSMWVEdHVkeDRwaDh2ZGs) -- Constantly updated collection of shared docs. Doesn't have to be a google doc (spreadsheet, doc) -- but serves as the rough and tumble file repository.

- [Peace Corps Community on Slack](http://www.peacecorpscommunity.slack.com) -- RPCV-run Slack team -- a great place to chat with fellow Volunteers, RPCVs, and partners. You'll [need an invite](slack.peacecorpsict4d.org), and right now it's open to all. What is Slack? Think of it like a big chat room for everyone interested in Peace Corps topics -- with built-in 'channels' for #ict4d and everything.

- [ICT4D Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/FEygL) -- Periodic (about one/week) updates from the PC/Washington ICT4D Initiative folks (me!). Check out the [archived newsletters as well](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=f01e279afc825e8e4c097e001&id=7f5b83c088)

- [ICT4D on the Peace Corps Intranet](https://inside.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?branch=234) -- Portal for Peace Corps staff and Volunteers. Nothing on here that's not also on the Playbook (effort towards transparency -- I didn't want to make a 'Volunteer' Playbook and a 'Staff' Playbook. That'd just be silly.)
